	Base R ships with much functionality for analysing ecological and environmental 
    data, in particular in the standard package stats. This
    functionality is complemented by many packages on CRAN, which allow specific models 
    particularly suited to analysing the sorts of multivariate data often produced within
    ecology and the environmental sciences. In particular, ordination methods are well provided for, with a 
    number of packages on CRAN implementing methods widely used in the field. A brief overview
    is given below. There is also considerable overlap between the tools
    for ecological and environmental data analysis in this view and spatial data analysis 
    in the <view>Spatial</view> view.
    
    The following methods are typical of the types of analyses applied to ecological and 
    environmental data. The packages required to run these analyses are listed. If you think 
    that a package is missing from the list or that priority should be given to certain packages, please contact the maintainer.
    <ul>
        <li><em>Modelling species responses and other data</em>: Simple (multiple) linear regression models are fitted by
        <tt>lm()</tt> and Generalised Linear Models (GLM) are fitted by <tt>glm()</tt> in standard package stats. 
        Generalised Additive Model (GAM) functionality is provided by recommended package <pkg>mgcv</pkg> and an implementation of the S-PLUS
        function <tt>gam()</tt> is provided by <pkg>gam</pkg>.</li>
        <li><em>Tree-based models</em>: Tree-structured models for regression, classification and survival analysis, 
        following the ideas in the CART book, are implemented in <pkg>rpart</pkg> (shipped with base R) and 
        <pkg>VR</pkg> (package tree). An adaptation of <pkg>rpart</pkg> for multivariate responses is available in package <pkg>mvpart</pkg>. 
        The validity of trees can be investigated via permutation approaches with package 
        <pkg>rpart.permutation</pkg>. Graphical tools for the visualization of trees are available in packages 
        <pkg>maptree</pkg> and <pkg>pinktoe</pkg>. The Random Forest method of Breiman and Cutler is implemented in
        <pkg>randomForest</pkg>, providing classification and regression based on a forest of trees using random inputs. Package <pkg>ipred</pkg> 
        provides functions for improved predictive models for classification, regression and survival problems.
        <pkg>mda</pkg> implements Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, which provides a more flexible, tree-based approach to regression
        than the piecewise constant functions used in regression trees.</li>
        <li><em>Ordination</em>: 
            <ul>
                <li>Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is available in <tt>prcomp()</tt> (preferred) and <tt>princomp()</tt> in standard 
                package stats. Packages <pkg>vegan</pkg> (<tt>rda()</tt>)and <pkg>labdsv</pkg> (<tt>pca()</tt>) provide more ecologically-oriented
                implementations. A form of PCA used in the climate and climate change fields is Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF)
                analysis. <tt>EOF()</tt> in package <pkg>clim.pact</pkg> provides and implementation of EOF.</li>
                <li>Redundancy Analysis (RDA) is available via <tt>rda()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg> and <tt>pcaiv()</tt> in <pkg>ade4</pkg>.</li>
                <li>Correspondence Analysis (CA) is available in <tt>cca()</tt> (<pkg>vegan</pkg>).</li>
                <li>Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is implemented in <tt>cca()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg>.</li>
                <li>Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) is implemented in <tt>decorana()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg>.</li> 
                <li>Principal coordinates analysis (PCO) is implemented in <tt>pco()</tt> in <pkg>labdsv</pkg> and <tt>cmdscale()</tt> in 
                package MASS in <pkg>VR</pkg>.</li>
                <li>Non-Metric multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) is provided by <tt>isoMDS()</tt> in package MASS in bundle <pkg>VR</pkg> and
                <tt>nmds()</tt> in <pkg>labdsv</pkg>. <pkg>vegan</pkg> provides helper functions for <tt>isoMDS()</tt> for random starts of the 
                algorithm and standardised scaling of results.</li>
                <li>Coinertia analysis is in <tt>coinertia()</tt> and <tt>mcoa()</tt>, both in <pkg>ade4</pkg>.</li>
                <li>Co-correspondence analysis to relate two ecological species data matrices is available in <pkg>cocorresp</pkg>.</li>
                <li>Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCoA - not to be confused with CCA, above) is available in <tt>cancor()</tt> in standard package 
                stats.</li>
                <li>Procrustes rotation is available in <tt>procrustes()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg> and <tt>procuste()</tt> in <pkg>ade4</pkg>, 
                with both <pkg>vegan</pkg> and <pkg>ade4</pkg> providing functions to test the significance of the association between ordination 
                configurations (as assessed by Procrustes rotation) using permutation/randomisation and Monte Carlo methods.</li>
                <li><tt>capscale()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg> provides the [Partial] Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates method that is 
                similar to that of Anderson and Willis (2003), see <pkg>vegan</pkg> for more information and the reference.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><em>Environmental time series</em>: Classical time series functionality is provided by the <tt>ar()</tt>, and 
        <tt>arima()</tt> functions in standard package stats for autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), 
        autoregressive moving  average (ARMA) and integrated ARMA (ARIMA) models. The <pkg>dse1</pkg> and <pkg>dse2</pkg> packages 
        in the <tt>dse</tt> bundle provide a variety of more advanced estimation methods and multivariate time series analysis.
        Other contributed packages for time series include <pkg>tseries</pkg> and <pkg>zoo</pkg> for regular times series and <pkg>zoo</pkg>, 
        <pkg>its</pkg> and <tt>itrs()</tt> in <pkg>tseries</pkg> for irregularly sampled time series. <pkg>pastecs</pkg> provides functions 
        specifically tailored for the analysis of space-time ecological series. <pkg>strucchange</pkg>
        allows for testing, dating and monitoring of structural change in linear regression relationships.</li>
        <li><em>Cluster analysis</em>: Function <tt>dist()</tt> in stats, <tt>vegdist()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg>
        <tt>dsvdis()</tt> in <pkg>labdsv</pkg>, <tt>Dist()</tt> in <pkg>amap</pkg> and a suite of functions in <pkg>ade4</pkg> 
        calculate dissimilarity matrices from a wide range of coefficients. 
        <tt>hclust()</tt> in stats and <tt>hcluster()</tt> in <pkg>amap</pkg> fit hierarchical cluster analyses using a 
        number of fusion methods. Recommended package <pkg>cluster</pkg> provides functions for cluster analysis following 
        the methods described in Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990 - Finding Groups in data: an introduction to cluster analysis. 
        Wiley, New York.), including hierarchical, divisive, K-mediods and fuzzy clustering techniques. <tt>kmeans()</tt> in
        stats provides K-means clustering and <tt>cmeans()</tt> in <pkg>e1071</pkg> implements a fuzzy version of
        the K-means algorithm. <pkg>mclust</pkg> and <pkg>flexmix</pkg> provide implementations of model-based cluster analysis.</li>
        <li><em>Models related to ecological theory</em>: <pkg>untb</pkg> provides a collection of utilities for biodiversity data, including the 
        simulation ecological drift under Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity, and the calculation of various diagnostics 
        such as Preston curves. <pkg>vegan</pkg> provides a wide range of functions related to ecological theory, including diversity indices 
        (including the <q>so-called</q>Hill's numbers [e.g. Hill's N<sup>2</sup>] and rarefaction), ranked abundance diagrams, Fisher's log series, 
        Broken Stick model, Hubbell's abundance model, amongst others.</li>
