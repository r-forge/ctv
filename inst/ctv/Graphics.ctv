    R is rich with facilities for creating and developing interesting graphics.
    Base R contains functionality for many plot types including coplots, 
    mosaic plots, biplots, and the list goes on. There are devices such as 
    postscript, png, jpeg and pdf for outputting graphics as well as device
    drivers for all platforms running R. <pkg>lattice</pkg> and 
    <pkg> grid</pkg> are supplied with R's recommended packages and are 
    included in every binary distribution. <pkg>lattice</pkg> is an R 
    implementation of William Cleveland's trellis graphics, while grid 
    defines a much more flexible graphics environment than the base R graphics.
    
    R's base graphics are implemented in the same way as in the S3
    system developed by Becker, Chambers, and Wilks. There is a static
    device, which is treated as a static canvas and objects are drawn on
    the device through R plotting commands. The device has a set of global
    parameters such as margins and layouts which can be manipulated by the
    user using <tt>par()</tt> commands. The R graphics engine does not maintain a
    user visible graphics list, and there is no system of double
    buffering, so objects cannot be easily edited without redrawing a whole
    plot. However, the base R graphics can produce many plots with
    extremely fine graphics in many specialized instances.  

    One can quickly run into trouble with R's base graphic system if
    one wants to design complex layouts where scaling is maintained
    properly on resizing, nested graphs are desired or more interactivity
    is needed. <pkg>grid</pkg> was designed by Paul Murrell to overcome
    some of these limitations and as a result packages like
    <pkg>lattice</pkg>, <pkg>vcd</pkg> or hexbin
    (on <a href="http://www.BioConductor.org/">BioConductor</a>) use
    grid for the underlying primitives. When using plots designed with
    grid one needs to keep in mind that grid is based on a system of
    viewports and graphic objects. To add objects one needs to use grid
    commands, e.g., <tt>grid.polygon()</tt> rather than <tt>polygon()</tt>. Also grid
    maintains a stack of viewports from the device and one needs to make
    sure the desired viewport is at the top of the stack. There is a great
    deal of explanatory documentation included with <pkg>grid</pkg> as
    vignettes.     


    The graphics packages in R can be organized roughly into the following 
    topics, although the categories are not mutually exclusive:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Graphics Systems</i>: <pkg>lattice</pkg> is built on top of the <pkg>grid</pkg>
          graphics system and is an R implementation of William Cleveland's trellis
	  system for S-PLUS. <pkg>lattice</pkg> allows for building many types of plots
	  with sophisticated layouts based on conditioning. <pkg>ggplot</pkg> is an R 
          implementation of the system described in "A Grammar of Graphics" by Leland 
          Wilkinson. Like <pkg>lattice</pkg>, <pkg>ggplot</pkg> (also built on top of grid)
	  assists in trellis-like graphics, but allows for much more. Since it is built on
	  the idea of a semantics for graphics there is much more emphasis on reshaping
	  data, transformation, and assembling the elements of a plot.</li>
      <li><i>Plotting</i>:
          Enhancements for specialized plots can be found in <pkg>plotrix</pkg>,
	  for polar plotting, <pkg>vcd</pkg> for categorical data, hexbin
	  (on <a href="http://www.BioConductor.org/">BioConductor</a>)
	  for hexagon binning, and gplots from the <pkg>gregmisc</pkg> bundle
	  for some plotting enhancements.
          For 3D plots <pkg>lattice</pkg>,
	  <pkg>scatterplot3d</pkg> and <pkg>misc3d</pkg> provide a selection of plots for
	  different kinds of 3D plotting. <pkg>scatterplot3d</pkg> is based on R's base
	  graphics system, while <pkg>misc3d</pkg> is based on
          <pkg>rgl</pkg>. The package <pkg>onion</pkg> for visualizing 
          quaternions and octonions is well suited to display 3D graphics
          based on derived meshes.</li>
      <li><i>Applications</i>: This area is not much different from the plotting section
          except that these packages focus on particular applications. The <pkg>gclus</pkg>
	  package focuses on the ordering of graphs to accentuate cluster structure or 
          natural ordering in the data. <pkg>klaR</pkg> focuses on classification methods 
          and how to visualize the separation in high dimensional spaces and there are also 
          some similar plots in <pkg>fpc</pkg>. <pkg>ape</pkg> has functions for plotting 
          phylogenetic trees, and <pkg>LDheatmap</pkg> does specialized plotting for 
          linkage disequilibrium in genetic trait mapping applications. <pkg>Rgraphviz</pkg>
          and <pkg>igraph</pkg> have functions for plotting and layout of graphs.</li>
      <li><i>Devices</i>: Whereas <pkg>grid</pkg> is built on top of
          the R graphics engine, many in the R community have found the R
          graphics engine somewhat inflexible and have written separate device
          drivers that either emphasize interactivity or plotting in various
          graphics formats. R base supplies devices for PostScript, PDF, JPEG
          and other formats. Devices on CRAN include <pkg>cairoDevice</pkg> which
          is a device based libcairo, which can actually render to many device
          types. The cairo device is desgned to work with <pkg>RGTK2</pkg>,
          which is an interface to the Gimp Tool Kit, similar to pyGTK2. <pkg>GDD</pkg>
          provides device drivers for several bitmap formats, including GIF and
          BMP. <pkg>RSvgDevice</pkg> is an SVG device driver and interfaces well with
          with vector drawing programs, or R web development packages, such as
          <pkg>Rpad</pkg>. When SVG devices for web display developers should be
          aware that internet explorer does not support SVG, but has their own
          standard. Trust Microsoft.
          <pkg>rgl</pkg> provides a device driver
          based on OpenGL, and is good for 3D and interactive
          development. Lastly, the Augsburg group supplies a set of packages
          that includes a Java-based device, <pkg>JavaGD</pkg>.</li>
      <li><i>Colors</i>: The package <pkg>colorspace</pkg> provides a set of functions for
          transforming between color spaces and <tt>mixcolor()</tt> for mixing colors
          within a color space.
	  Based on the HCL colors provided in <pkg>colorspace</pkg>, <pkg>vcd</pkg>
	  provides a set of functions for choosing color palettes suitable for
	  coding categorical variables (<tt>rainbow_hcl()</tt>) and numerical 
	  information (<tt>sequential_hcl()</tt>, <tt>diverge_hcl()</tt>). Similar
	  types of palettes are provided in <pkg>RColorBrewer</pkg> and <pkg>dichromat</pkg>
          is focused on palettes for color-impaired viewers.</li>
      <li><i>Dynamic Graphics</i>: There are several efforts to
          implement dynamic graphics systems that interface well with R. <pkg>rggobi</pkg>
          embeds the GGobi interactive graphics system within R, so that one can display a data
          frame or several in GGobi directly from R. The package has functions
          to support longitudinal data, and graphs using GGobi's edge set
          functionality. The RoSuDA repository maintained and developed by the
          University of Augsburg group has two packages, <pkg>iplots</pkg> and iwidgets as
          well as their Java development environment including a Java
          device, <pkg>JavaGD</pkg>. Their interactive graphics tools contain functions for
          alpha blending, which produces darker shading around areas with more
          data. This is exceptionally useful for parallel coordinate plots where
          many lines can quickly obscure patterns. Lastly, the <pkg>rgl</pkg> package has mechanisms for
          interactive manipulation of plots, especially 3D rotations and surfaces.</li>        
      <li><i>Development</i>: For development of specialized
          graphics packages in R, <pkg>grid</pkg> should probably be the first
          consideration for any new plot type. <pkg>rgl</pkg> has better tools for
          3D graphics, since the device is interactive, though it can be slow. 
          An alternative is to use Java and
          the Java device in the RoSuDA packages, though Java has its own
          drawbacks. For porting plotting code to <pkg>grid</pkg>, using the
          package <pkg>gridBase</pkg> presents a nice intermediate step to embed
          base graphics in grid graphics and vice versa.</li>
