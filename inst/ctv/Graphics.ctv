    R is rich with facilities for creating and developing interesting graphics.
    Base R contains functionality for many plot types including coplots, 
    mosaic plots, biplots, and the list goes on. There are devices such as 
    postscript, png, jpeg and pdf for outputting graphics as well as device
    drivers for all platforms running R. <pkg>lattice</pkg> and 
    <pkg> grid</pkg> are supplied with R's reccomended packages and are 
    usually there in a basic installation. <pkg>lattice</pkg> is an R 
    implementation of Willaim Cleveland's trellis graphics, while grid 
    defines a much more flexible graphics environment than the base R graphics.
    
    The graphics packages in R can be organized roughly, categories are not 
    mutually exclusive, into the following topics:
    <ul>
      <li><i>Plotting</i>: <pkg>lattice</pkg> is built on top of the <pkg>grid</pkg>
          graphics system and is an R implementation of Willaim Cleveland's trellis
	  system for S-PLUS. <pkg>lattice</pkg> allows building of many plot types
	  with sophisticated layouts based on conditioning. For 3d plots <pkg>lattice</pkg>,
	  <pkg>scatterplot3d</pkg> and <pkg>misc3d</pkg> provide a selcetion of plots for
	  different kinds of 3d plotting. <pkg>scatterplot3d</pkg> is based on R's base
	  graphics system, while <pkg>misc3d</pkg> is based on <pkg>rgl</pkg>.
	  Further enhancements for specialized plots can be found in <pkg>plotrix</pkg>,
	  for polar plotting, <pkg>vcd</pkg> for categorical data, <pkg>hexbin</pkg>
	  <!-- FIXME: hexagon not on CRAN -->
	  for hexagon binning, and <pkg>gplots</pkg> from the <pkg>gregmisc</pkg> bundle
	  for some plotting enhancements</li>
      <li><i>Applications</i>: This area is not much different from the plotting section
          except that these packages focus on particular applications. The <pkg>gclus</pkg>
	  package focuses on the ordering of graphs to accentuate cluster structure or natrual
	  ordering in the data. <pkg>klaR</pkg> focuses on classification methods and how to
	  visualize the seperation in high dimensional spaces. <pkg>ape</pkg> has functions
	  for plotting phylogenetic trees, and <pkg>LDheatmap</pkg> does specialized plotting
	  for linkage disequilibrium in genetic trait mapping applications.</li>
      <li><i>Devices </i>: Whereas <pkg>grid</pkg> is built on top of the R graphics engine,
          many in the R community are fed up with the lack of flexibility in the base R graphics
	  engine and have written seperate device drivers that either emphasize interactivity or
	  plotting in various graphics formats. R base supplies devices for postscript, pdf, jpeg
	  and other formats. Devices on CRAN include <pkg>gtkDevice</pkg> which is a device based
	  on GTK (The Gimp Toolkit), an open source graphics tool kit. <pkg>gtkDevice</pkg>
	  interfaces well with the <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RGtk/">RGtk</a> package on the
	  <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/">Omeghat</a> site.
	  <pkg>GDD</pkg> provides device drivers for several bitmap formats, including gif and bmp.
	  <pkg>RSvgDevice</pkg> is an SVG device driver and interfaces will with vector drawing
	  programs. <pkg>rgl</pkg> provides a device driver based on OpenGL, and is good for 3D
	  and interactive development. Lastly, the Augsburg group supplies a set of packages that
	  includes a Java-based device.</li>
      <li><i>Colors</i>: There are three main packages dealing with color, <pkg>colorspace</pkg>
          which provides a set of functions for transformaing between colorspaces and mixcolor for
	  mixing colors within a colorspace. <pkg>RColorBrewer</pkg>, and <pkg>dichromat</pkg>
	  provide specialized palates, <pkg>dichromat</pkg> is focused on the color impaired.</li>
      <li><i>Dynamic Graphics</i>: There are several efforts to implement dynamic graphics systems
          that interface well with R. RGgobi embeds the Ggobi interactive graphics sytem within R,
	  so that one can display a data frame or several in ggobi directly from R. RoSuDA R packages
	  from the University of Augsburg group has two packages, iplots and iwidgets as well as
	  their Java development environment including a java device. Lastly, the <pkg>rgl</pkg>
	  package has mehcanisms for interactive manipulation of plots.</li>
      <li><i>Development</i>: For development of of specialized graphics packages in R <pkg>grid</pkg>
          should probably be the first condieration for any new plot type. <pkg>rgl</pkg> has most
	  tools for 3D graphics, though it can be slow. An alternative is to use Java and the java
	  device in the RoSuDA packages, though Java has its own drawbacks. For porting plotting
	  code to <pkg>grid</pkg>, using the package <pkg>gridBase</pkg> presents a nice intermediate
	  step to embed base garhics in grid graphics and vice versa.</li>
    </ul>
