    <p>Base R contains most of the functionality for classical multivariate analysis,
       somewhere. There are a large number of packages on CRAN which extend this methodology,
       a brief overview is given below. Application-specific uses of multivariate statistics
       are described in relevant task views, for example whilst principal components are listed here, 
       ordination is covered in the <view>Environmetics</view> task view.</p>

       <p>The packages in this view can be roughly structured into the following topics.
       If you think that some package is missing from the list, please let me know.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Visualising multivariate data</i>:
          A range of base graphics and <pkg>lattice</pkg> functions are useful for
	  visualising pairwise arrays of 2-dimensional scatterplots and 3-dimensional densities.
	  Beyond this, <pkg>scatterplot3d</pkg>
	  provides 3 dimensional scatterplots, <pkg>misc3d</pkg>, dependent upon <pkg>rgl</pkg>,
	  provides animated functions within R useful for visualising densities.
	  More specialised multivariate plots include the following: 
	  <tt>faces()</tt> in <pkg>TeachingDemos</pkg> provides Chernoff's faces;
	  <tt>parcoord()</tt> rom MASS (in the <pkg>VR</pkg> bundle) provides parallel coordinate plots;
          <tt>stars()</tt> in graphics provides a choice of star, radar and cobweb plots respectively. 
	  Mosaic plots are available via <tt>mosaicplot()</tt> in graphics and <tt>mosaic()</tt>
	  in <pkg>vcd</pkg> that also contains other visualization techniques for multivariate
	  categorical data. <pkg>gclus</pkg> provides a number of 
          cluster specific graphical enhancements for scatterplots and parallel coordinate plots
	  See the links for a reference to GGobi; <pkg>xgobi</pkg> interfaces to the XGobi
	  and XGvis programs which allow linked, dynamic multivariate plots as well as
	  projection pursuit.</li>
      <li><i>Multivariate normal distributions</i>:
          <tt>var()</tt> and <tt>cor()</tt> in stats will provide estimates of the covariance
          and correlation  matrices respectively. <tt>cov.rob()</tt> in MASS
          provides robust estimates of the variance-covariance matrix by minimum volume 
          ellipsoid, minimum covariance determinant or classical product-moment. <pkg>covRobust</pkg> 
          provides robust covariance estimation via nearest neighbor variance estimation.          
          <tt>mvnorm()</tt> in MASS simulates from the multivariate normal 
          distribution. <pkg>mvtnorm</pkg> also provides simulation as well as probability and 
          quantile functions for both the multivariate t distribution and multivariate normal 
          distributions as well as density functions for the multivariate normal distribution.   
          Density and random numbers for multivariate normal mixtures are provided by 
          <tt>rmvnorm.mixt()</tt> and <tt>dmvnorm.mixt()</tt> in <pkg>ks</pkg>,
FIXME:	  multivariate normal mixture fitting is also found within <pkg>bayesm</pkg>.
FIXME: only there?
	  <pkg>mvnormtest</pkg> provides a multivariate extension
	  to the Shapiro-Wilks test, <pkg>mvoutlier</pkg> provides multivariate outlier detection based
	  on robust methods. <pkg>corpcor</pkg> provides shrinkage estimation of large scale covariance
	  and (partial) correlation. <tt>bkde2D()</tt> from <pkg>KernSmooth</pkg> and <tt>kde2d()</tt>

          From stats, <tt>lm()</tt> (with a matrix specified as the dependent variable)
	  offers multivariate linear models and <tt>manova()</tt> offers MANOVA. <pkg>pls.pcr</pkg>
	  provides partial least squares regression (PLSR) and principal component regression,

	  further principal component method.</li>
      <li><i>Projection methods</i>:

	  preferred) as well as <tt>princomp()</tt> (based on <tt>eigen()</tt> for  compatibility
	  with S-PLUS) from stats. <pkg>sca</pkg> provides simple components. <pkg>amap</pkg> provides
	  further robust and parallelised methods such as generalised 
	  and robust principal component analysis via <tt>acpgen()</tt> and <tt>acprob()</tt> 
          respectively. <pkg>fastICA</pkg> provides fastICA algorithms to perform independent
	  component analysis (ICA) and Projection Pursuit, <pkg>mlica</pkg> provides
	  maximum likelihood fitting for ICA. <tt>cancor()</tt> in stats provides

	  setting are also available within <pkg>ade4</pkg>. <tt>procrustes()</tt> in
	  <pkg>vegan</pkg> provides procrustes analysis, this package also provides functions
	  for ordination. Further information on ordination is given in the
          <view>Environmetrics</view> task view.</li>
      <li><i>Principal coordinates methods</i>:
          <tt>cmdscale()</tt> in stats provides classical multidimensional scaling
