    <p>Applied researchers interested in Bayesian statistics
    are increasingly attracted to R because of the ease of which one can
    code algorithms to sample from posterior distributions as well as
    the significant number of packages contributed to the Comprehensive
    R Archive Network (CRAN) that provide tools for Bayesian inference.
    This task view catalogs these tools. In this task view, we divide
    those packages into four groups based on the scope and focus of the
    packages.  We first review R packages that provide Bayesian
    estimation tools for a wide range of models.  We then discuss
    packages that address specific Bayesian models or specialized
    methods in Bayesian statistics.  This is followed by a description
    of packages used for post-estimation analysis.  Finally, we review
    packages that link R to other Bayesian sampling engines such as
    JAGS, OpenBUGS, and WinBUGS.</p>
    
    <p> This is a preliminary task view, and we have likely missed some
    important information.  Please email the
    <a href="mailto:jhpark@artsci.wustl.edu?subject=Bayesian%20Task%20View">task view maintainer</a>
    with any feedback.</p>
  
    <ul>
    <li><em>Bayesian packages for general model fitting:</em> 
    <pkg>bayesm</pkg> provides R functions for Bayesian inference for
    various models widely used in marketing and micro-econometrics. The
    models include linear regression models, multinomial logit,
    multinomial probit, multivariate probit, multivariate mixture of
    normals, hierarchical linear models, and linear instrumental
    variable models.
   
    <pkg>bayesSurv</pkg> contains R functions to perform Bayesian
    inference for various survival regression models.
    
    <pkg>MCMCpack</pkg> provides model-specific Markov chain Monte Carlo
    (MCMC) algorithms for wide range of models commonly used in the social
    and behavioral sciences. It contains R functions
    to fit a number a regression models (linear regression, logit,
    ordinal probit, probit, Poisson regression, etc.), measurement
    models (item response theory and factor models), and models for
    ecological inference.  It also contains a generic Metropolis sampler
    that can be used to fit arbitrary models.  All <pkg>MCMCpack</pkg>
    functions return <tt>mcmc</tt> objects that can be analyzed with
    methods defined in the <pkg>coda</pkg> package.
    
    The package <pkg>mcmc</pkg> consists of an R function for a random-walk 
    Metropolis algorithm for a continuous random vector.
    </li>  

    <li><em>Bayesian packages for specific models or methods</em>:
    <pkg>bqtl</pkg> can be used to fit quantitative trait loci (QTL)
    models. This package allows Bayesian estimation of multi-gene models
    via Laplace approximations and provides tools for interval mapping of 
    genetic loci. <pkg>bim</pkg> provides a function for Bayesian interval
    mapping using MCMC methods.  Both of
    these packages contain graphical tools for QTL analysis.
    
    The <pkg>BMA</pkg> package has functions for Bayesian model
    averaging for linear models, generalized linear models, and survival
    models.  The complementary package <pkg>ensembleBMA</pkg> uses the
    <pkg>BMA</pkg> package to create probabilistic forecasts of
    ensembles using a mixture of normal distributions.
    
    <pkg>deal</pkg> provides R functions for Bayesian network analysis;
    the current version of covers discrete and continuous variables
    under Gaussian network structure. 
    
    <pkg>EbayesThresh</pkg> implements Bayesian estimation for
    thresholding methods. Although the original model is developed in
    the context of wavelets, this package is useful when researchers
    need to take advantage of possible sparsity in a parameter set.
    
    <pkg>eco</pkg> fits Bayesian ecological inference models in two by two
    tables using MCMC methods.
    
    <pkg>evdbayes</pkg> provides tools for Bayesian analysis of extreme value 
    models.
    
    <pkg>exactLoglinTest</pkg> provides functions for log-linear models that
    compute  Monte Carlo estimates of conditional P-values for goodness of fit 
    tests. 

    The <tt>gbayes()</tt> function in <pkg>Hmisc</pkg> derives the
    posterior (and optionally) the predictive distribution when both the
    prior and the likelihood are Gaussian, and when the statistic of
    interest comes from a two-sample problem.
        
    The function <tt>krige.bayes()</tt> in the <pkg>geoR</pkg> package
    performs Bayesian analysis of geostatistical data allowing
    specification of different levels of uncertainty in the model
    parameters.  The <tt>binom.krige.bayes()</tt> function in the
    <pkg>geoRglm</pkg> package implements Bayesian posterior simulation
    and spatial prediction for the binomial spatial model (see the
    <view>Spatial</view> view for more information). 
    
    The <pkg>MNP</pkg> package fits multinomial probit model using MCMC methods.
    
    The <tt>vcov.gam()</tt> function the <pkg>mgcv</pkg> package can
    extract a Bayesian posterior covariance matrix of the parameters
    from a fitted <tt>gam</tt> object.
     
    <pkg>vabayelMix</pkg> provides R functions to perform Bayesian inference 
    for a Gaussian mixture model using a variational approach.
    </li>
    
    <li><em>Post-estimation tools</em>:
    
    The <pkg>boa</pkg> package provides functions for diagnostics,
    summarization, and visualization of MCMC sequences.  It imports
    draws from BUGS format, or from plain matrices. <pkg>boa</pkg>
    provides the Gelman and Rubin, Geweke, Heidelberger and Welch, and
    Raftery and Lewis diagnostics, the Brooks and Gelman multivariate
    shrink factors.

    The <pkg>coda</pkg> (Convergence
    Diagnosis and Output Analysis) package is a suite of functions that
    can be used to summarize, plot, and and diagnose convergence from
    MCMC samples. <pkg>coda</pkg> also defines an <tt>mcmc</tt> object
    and related methods which are used by other packages.  It can easily
    import MCMC output from WinBUGS, OpenBUGS, and JAGS, or from plain
    matrices.  <pkg>coda</pkg> contains the Gelman and Rubin, Geweke,
    Heidelberger and Welch, and Raftery and Lewis diagnostics.
    
    <pkg>mcgibbsit</pkg> provides the Warnes and Raftery MCGibbsit MCMC
    diagnostic.  It operates on <tt>mcmc</tt> objects.
    </li>

    <li><em>Packages that link R to other sampling engines</em>:
    
    <pkg>bayesmix</pkg> is an R package to fit Bayesian mixture models
    using <a  href="http://www-fis.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/"
    target="_blank">JAGS</a>.
    
    <pkg>BRugs</pkg> provides an R interface on Windows machines to <a
    href="http://mathstat.helsinki.fi/openbugs/"
    target="_blank">OpenBUGS</a>.
    
    There are two packages that can be used to interface R with <a
    href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/"
    target="_blank">WinBUGS</a>. <pkg>R2WinBUGS</pkg> provides a set of
    functions to call WinBUGS on a Windows system;  <pkg>rbugs</pkg>
    supports Linux systems by running WinBUGS through <a
    href="http://www.winehq.com/" target="_blank">WINE</a>.
    
    All of these BUGS engines use graphical models for model
    specification.  As such, the <view>gR</view> task view may be of
    interest.
