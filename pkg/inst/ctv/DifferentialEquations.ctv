    <p> Differential equations (DE) are mathematical equations that describe how a 
     quantity changes as a function of one or several (independent) variables, often 
     time or space.   
     Differential equations play an important role in biology, chemistry, physics,
     engineering, economy and other disciplines.
    </p>
    <p> Differential equations can be separated into stochastic versus deterministic
     DEs. Problems can be split into initial value problems versus boundary value problems.
     One also distinguishes ordinary differential equations from 
     partial differential equations, differential algebraic equations and delay differential equations.
     All these types of DEs can be solved in R. 
     DE problems can be classified to be either stiff or nonstiff; the former type of problems are 
     much more difficult to solve.

    <p>The 
    <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-dynamic-models">dynamic models SIG</a>    
     is a suitable mailing list for discussing the use of R for solving differential equation 
     and other dynamic models such as individual-based or agent-based models.

    <p><strong>Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)</strong></p> 
     In a stochastic differential equation, the unknown quantity is a 
     stochastic process. 
     <ul>
       <li> The package <pkg>sde</pkg> provides functions for simulation and inference for 
        stochastic differential equations. It is the accompanying package to 
        the book by Iacus (2008).
       </li>
       <li> The package <pkg>pomp</pkg> contains functions for statistical inference for
        partially observed Markov processes. 
       </li>
       <li> Packages <pkg>adaptivetau</pkg> and <pkg>GillespieSSA</pkg> implement 
        Gillespie's "exact" stochastic simulation algorithm (direct method) 
        and several approximate methods.
       </li> 
       <li> The package <pkg>Sim.DiffProc</pkg> provides functions for simulation of 
        It√¥ and Stratonovitch stochastic differential equations.
       </li> 
       <li> Package <pkg>diffeqr</pkg> can solve SDE problems using the <strong>DifferentialEquations.jl</strong> 
	package from the Julia programming language.
       </li> 
     </ul>  
      
    <p><strong>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)</strong></p> 
     In an ODE, the unknown quantity is a function of a single independent variable.
     Several packages offer to solve ODEs.
     <ul>
       <li> The "odesolve" package was the first to solve ordinary differential equations in R.
        It contained two integration methods. It has been replaced by the package <pkg>deSolve</pkg>.
       </li>
       <li> The package <pkg>deSolve</pkg> contains several solvers for solving ODE, DAE, DDE and PDE. 
        It can deal with stiff and nonstiff problems.
       </li>
       <li> The package <pkg>deTestSet</pkg> contains solvers designed for solving 
        very stiff equations.
       </li>
       <li> The package <pkg>odeintr</pkg> generates and compiles C++ ODE solvers on the fly using Rcpp
            and <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> <a href="http://www.odeint.com/">odeint</a>.
       </li>
       <li>
          The R package <pkg>diffeqr</pkg> provides a seamless interface to the <strong>DifferentialEquations.jl</strong> 
          package from the Julia programming language. It has unique high performance methods for solving ODE, SDE, DDE, DAE and more. 
          Models can be written in either R or Julia. It requires an installation of the Julia language.
       </li>
       <li>Package <pkg>pracma</pkg> implements several adaptive Runge-Kutta
        solvers such as ode23, ode23s, ode45, or the Burlisch-Stoer algorithm to obtain
        numerical solutions to ODEs with higher accuracy.
       </li>
       <li>Package <pkg>rODE</pkg> (inspired from the book of Gould, Tobochnik and Christian, 2016) 
         aims to show physics, math and engineering students 
         how ODE solvers can be made with R's S4 classes.
       </li>
	   <li>Package <pkg>sundialr</pkg> provides a way to call the 'CVODE' function from the 'SUNDIALS' C ODE solving library. 
	     The package requires the ODE to be written as an 'R' or 'Rcpp' function.
	   </li>
    </ul>        
    <p><strong>Delay Differential Equations (DDEs)</strong></p> 
     In a DDE, the derivative at a certain time is a function of the variable value at a previous time.
     <ul>
	   <li> The <pkg>dde</pkg> package implements solvers for ordinary (ODE) and delay (DDE) differential equations, 
	   where the objective function is written in either R or C. Suitable only for non-stiff equations. 
	   Support is also included for iterating difference equations.
       </li>
       <li> The package <pkg>PBSddesolve</pkg> (originally published as "ddesolve") 
        includes a solver for non-stiff DDE problems.
       </li>
       <li> Functions in the package <pkg>deSolve</pkg> can solve both stiff and non-stiff DDE problems.
       </li> 
       <li> Package <pkg>diffeqr</pkg> can solve DDE problems using the <strong>DifferentialEquations.jl</strong> 
          package from the Julia programming language.
       </li> 
     </ul>
    <p><strong>Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)</strong></p> 
      PDEs are differential equations in which the unknown quantity is a 
      function of multiple independent variables. A common classification is 
      into elliptic (time-independent), hyperbolic (time-dependent and wavelike), 
      and parabolic (time-dependent and diffusive) equations. 
      One way to solve them is to rewrite the PDEs as a set of coupled 
      ODEs, and then use an efficient solver. 
      <ul>
       <li> The R-package <pkg>ReacTran</pkg> provides functions for converting the PDEs
        into a set of ODEs. Its main target is in the field of ''reactive transport'' 
        modelling, but it can be used to solve PDEs of the three main types. 
        It provides functions for discretising PDEs on cartesian, polar, 
        cylindrical and spherical grids.
       </li>
       <li> The package <pkg>deSolve</pkg> contains dedicated solvers for 1-D, 2-D and 
        3-D time-varying ODE problems as generated from PDEs (e.g. by <pkg>ReacTran</pkg>).
       </li>
       <li> Solvers for 1-D time varying problems can also be found in the package 
        <pkg>deTestSet</pkg>.
       </li> 
       <li> The package <pkg>rootSolve</pkg> contains optimized solvers for 1-D, 2-D and 
        3-D algebraic problems generated from (time-invariant) PDEs. 
        It can thus be used for solving elliptic equations.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Note that, to date, PDEs in R can only be solved using finite differences. 
      At some point, we hope that finite element and spectral methods will become available.
    <p><strong>Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs)</strong></p>
      Differential algebraic equations comprise both differential and algebraic terms.
      An important feature of a DAE is its differentiation index; the higher this index, 
      the more difficult to solve the DAE.
      <ul>
       <li> The package <pkg>deSolve</pkg> provides two solvers, that can handle DAEs up to index 3.
       </li>
       <li> Three more DAE solvers are in the package <pkg>deTestSet</pkg>.
       </li>
       <li> Package <pkg>diffeqr</pkg> can solve DAE problems using the <strong>DifferentialEquations.jl</strong> 
          package from the Julia programming language.
       </li> 
      </ul>       
    <p><strong>Boundary Value Problems (BVPs)</strong></p> 
      BVPs have solutions and/or derivative conditions specified 
      at the boundaries of the independent variable.
      <ul>
       <li> Package <pkg>bvpSolve</pkg> deals only with this type of equations.
       </li>
       <li> The package <pkg>ReacTran</pkg> can solve BVPs that belong to the 
       class of reactive transport equations.
       </li>
       <li> Package <pkg>diffeqr</pkg> can also solve BVPs using the <strong>DifferentialEquations.jl</strong> 
          package from the Julia programming language.
       </li> 
     </ul>
    <p><strong>Other</strong></p>
      <ul>
       <li> The  <pkg>simecol</pkg> package provides an interactive environment to 
        implement and simulate dynamic models. 
        Next to DE models, it also provides functions for grid-oriented, 
        individual-based, and particle diffusion models. 
      </li>
      <li> Package <pkg>scaRabee</pkg>
       offers frameworks for simulation and optimization of Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Models.
      </li>
      <li>In the package <pkg>FME</pkg> are functions for inverse modelling (fitting to data), 
       sensitivity analysis, identifiability and Monte Carlo Analysis of DE models.
      </li>
      <li>The package <pkg>nlmeODE</pkg> has functions for 
       mixed-effects modelling using differential equations.
      </li>
      <li> <pkg>mkin</pkg> provides routines for fitting kinetic models with one 
       or more state variables to chemical degradation data.
      </li>
      <li>Package <pkg>dMod</pkg> provides functions to generate ODEs of reaction networks, 
        parameter transformations, observation functions, residual functions, etc. 
        It follows the paradigm that derivative information should be used for optimization whenever possible.
      </li>
      <li>The package <pkg>CollocInfer</pkg> implements collocation-inference 
       for continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic processes.
      </li>
      <li>Root finding, equilibrium and steady-state analysis of ODEs can be 
       done with the package <pkg>rootSolve</pkg>.
      </li>
      <li> The <pkg>deTestSet</pkg> package contains many test problems for differential equations.
      </li> 
      <li> The <pkg>PBSmodelling</pkg> package adds GUI functions to models. 
      </li>
      <li>Package <pkg>cOde</pkg> supports the automatic creation of dynamically linked
        code for packages <pkg>deSolve</pkg> <pkg>bvpSolve</pkg> (or a built-in implementation
        of the sundials cvode solver) from inline C embedded in the R code.
      </li>
       <li>Package <pkg>rodeo</pkg> is an object oriented system and code generator that 
         creates and compiles efficient Fortran code for <pkg>deSolve</pkg> from models 
         defined in stoichiomatry matrix notation.
      </li>
      <li>Package <pkg>ecolMod</pkg> contains the figures, data sets and examples from a book 
       on ecological modelling (Soetaert and Herman, 2009).
      </li>
    </ul>
