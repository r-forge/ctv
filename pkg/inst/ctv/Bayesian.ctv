    <p>Applied researchers interested in Bayesian statistics
    are increasingly attracted to R because of the ease of which one can
    code algorithms to sample from posterior distributions as well as
    the significant number of packages contributed to the Comprehensive
    R Archive Network (CRAN) that provide tools for Bayesian inference.
    This task view catalogs these tools. In this task view, we divide
    those packages into four groups based on the scope and focus of the
    packages.  We first review R packages that provide Bayesian
    estimation tools for a wide range of models.  We then discuss
    packages that address specific Bayesian models or specialized
    methods in Bayesian statistics.  This is followed by a description
    of packages used for post-estimation analysis.  Finally, we review
    packages that link R to other Bayesian sampling engines such as
    <a href="http://www-fis.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/" target="_top">JAGS,</a>
    <a href="http://mathstat.helsinki.fi/openbugs/" target="_top">OpenBUGS,</a> and
    <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/" target="_top">WinBUGS.</a> </p>
    
    <p>

    <li>The <pkg>arm</pkg> package contains R functions for Bayesian inference using lm, glm, mer and polr objects.</li>
    <li><pkg>BACCO</pkg> is an R bundle for Bayesian analysis of random functions.  <pkg>BACCO</pkg>

    calibration of computer programs.</li>
    <li><pkg>bayesm</pkg> provides R functions for Bayesian inference for
    various models widely used in marketing and micro-econometrics. The
    models include linear regression models, multinomial logit,
    multinomial probit, multivariate probit, multivariate mixture of
    normals (including clustering), density estimation using finite mixtures of normals as well as Dirichlet Process priors, 
    hierarchical linear models, hierarchical multinomial logit,
    hierarchical negative binomial regression models, and linear instrumental
    variable models.

    inference for survival regression models with flexible error and random effects distributions.

    (MCMC) algorithms for wide range of models commonly used in the social

    <li><b>BRugs</b> provides an R interface on Windows machines to
    <a href="http://mathstat.helsinki.fi/openbugs/" target="_top">OpenBUGS</a>.

    at the <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/" target="_top">CRANextras</a>
    repository.</li>
    
    <li>There are two packages that can be used to interface R with

    interest.
