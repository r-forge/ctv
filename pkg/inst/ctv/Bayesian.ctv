   <p>Applied researchers interested in Bayesian statistics are increasingly 
    attracted to R because of the ease of which one can code algorithms to sample 
    from posterior distributions as well as the significant number of packages 
    contributed to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) that provide tools for Bayesian inference. 
    This task view catalogs these tools. In this task view, we divide those packages 
    into four groups based on the scope and focus of the packages.  We first review R packages 
    that provide Bayesian estimation tools for a wide range of models.  We then discuss
    packages that address specific Bayesian models or specialized methods in Bayesian statistics.  
    This is followed by a description of packages used for post-estimation analysis.  
    Finally, we review packages that link R to other Bayesian sampling engines such as
    <a href="http://www-fis.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/">JAGS</a>, 
    <a href="http://mathstat.helsinki.fi/openbugs/">OpenBUGS</a>, and
