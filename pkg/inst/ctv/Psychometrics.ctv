<info> Psychometrics is concerned with theory and techniques of psychological measurement.
Psychometricians have also worked collaboratively with those in the field of statistics and
quantitative methods to develop improved ways to organize, analyze, and scale
corresponding data. Since much functionality is already contained in base R and there
is considerable overlap between tools for psychometry and tools
described in other views, particularly in <view>SocialSciences</view>,
we only give a brief overview of packages that are closely related to
psychometric methodology.

something of importance, or if a new package or function
should be mentioned here.

  </li>
  <li>
    <pkg>prefmod</pkg> generates design matrices for analysing real paired
comparisons and derived paired comparison data 
    (Likert type items / ratings or rankings) using a loglinear approach. Fits
loglinear Bradley-Terry model (LLBT) exploting an eliminate feature. Computes
pattern models 
    for paired comparisons, rankings, and ratings. Some treatment of missing
values (MCAR and MNAR).
  </li>
  <li>
     Bradley-Terry models for paired comparisons are implemented in the package
<pkg>BradleyTerry2</pkg> 
     and in <pkg>eba</pkg>. The latter allows for the computation of
elimination-by-aspects models.
  </li>
  <li>
     Psychophysical data can be analyzed with the <pkg>psyphy</pkg> package. The
<pkg>MLCM</pkg> package contains functions to estimate the contribution of the n
scales to the judgment by a maximum likelihood method under several hypotheses
of how the perceptual dimensions interact.  
  </li>
  <li>
     Functions and example datasets for Fechnerian scaling of discrete object
sets are provided by <pkg>fechner</pkg>. It computes Fechnerian 
     distances among objects representing subjective dissimilarities, and other
related information.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <pkg>modelfree</pkg> package provides functions for nonparametric
estimation of a psychometric function and for estimation of a derived threshold
and slope, and their standard deviations and confidence intervals.
  </li>
  <li>
     Confidence intervals for standardized effect sizes: The <pkg>MBESS</pkg>
package.
  </li>
  <li>
  The <pkg>mediation</pkg> allows both parametric and nonparametric causal mediation analysis. 
  It also allows researchers to conduct sensitivity analysis for certain parametric models.
  </li>
  <li>
  Mediation analysis using natural effect models can be performed using <pkg>medflex</pkg>. 
 </li>
  <li>
  Functions for data screening, testing moderation, mediation, and estimating
power are contained in the <pkg>QuantPsyc</pkg> package. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The package <pkg>multiplex</pkg> is especially designed for social networks with relations at 
  different levels. In this sense, the program has effective ways to treat multiple networks data 
  sets with routines that combine algebraic structures like the partially ordered semigroup 
  with the existing relational bundles found in multiple networks. An algebraic approach for two-mode networks is made 
  through Galois derivations between families of the pair of subsets.
  </li>
  <li>
  The <pkg>qgraph</pkg> package can be used to visualize data as networks.
  </li>
  <li>
  Social Relations Analyses for round robin designs are implemented in the
<pkg>TripleR</pkg> package. It implements all functionality of the SOREMO
software, and provides new functions like the handling of missing values,
significance tests for single groups, or the calculation of the self enhancement
index.
  </li>
  <li>
  Fitting and testing multinomial processing tree models, a class of statistical
models for categorical data with latent parameters, can be performed using the
<pkg>mpt</pkg> package. These parameters are the link probabilities of a
tree-like graph and represent the cognitive processing steps executed to arrive
at observable response categories.The <pkg>MPTinR</pkg> package provides a
user-friendly way for analysis of multinomial processing tree (MPT) models.
  </li>
  <li>
  Beta regression for modeling beta-distributed dependent variables, e.g., rates
and proportions, is available in <pkg>betareg</pkg>.
  </li>
  <li>
  The <pkg>cocor</pkg> package provides functions to compare two correlations based on either dependent or independent groups.
  </li>
  <li>
   The <pkg>profileR</pkg> package provides a set of tools that implement profile
analysis and cross-validation techniques.
  </li>
  <li>
  The <pkg>TestScorer</pkg> package provides a GUI for entering test items and obtaining raw and transformed scores. The results are shown on the console and can be saved to a 
  tabular text file for further statistical analysis. The user can define his own tests and scoring procedures through a GUI.
  </li>
  <li>
    <pkg>missMDA</pkg> provides imputation of incomplete continuous or categorical datasets in principal component analysis (PCA), 
    multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) model, or multiple factor analysis (MFA) model. 
  </li>  
</ul>
