<p>This task view gathers information on specific R packages for design,
monitoring and analysis of data from  clinical trials. It focuses on including
packages for clinical trial design and monitoring in general plus data  analysis
packages for a specific type of design. Also, it gives a brief introduction to
important packages for  analyzing clinical trial data. Please refer to task
views <view>ExperimentalDesign</view>, <view>Survival</view>,
<view>Pharmacokinetics</view> for more details on these topics. Please feel free
to e-mail me regarding new packages or major package updates.</p>

<p><strong>Design and Monitoring</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><pkg>asd</pkg> This Package runs simulations for adaptive seamless designs using early outcomes for treatment selection.</li>
<li><pkg>bcrm</pkg> This package implements a wide variety of one and two-parameter Bayesian CRM designs. The program can run interactively, allowing the user to enter outcomes after each cohort has been recruited, or via simulation to assess operating characteristics.</li>

<li><pkg>Blockrand</pkg> creates randomizations for block random clinical
trials. It can also produce a PDF file of randomization cards.</li>
<li><pkg>conf.design</pkg> This small library contains a series of simple tools for constructing and manipulating confounded and fractional factorial designs.</li>
<li><pkg>crossdes</pkg> contains functions for the construction and randomization of balanced carryover balanced designs. Contains functions to check given designs for balance. Also contains functions for simulation studies on the validity of two randomization procedures.</li>
<li><pkg>CRTSize</pkg> This package contains basic tools for the purpose of sample size estimation in cluster (group) randomized trials. The package contains traditional power-based methods, empirical smoothing (Rotondi and Donner, 2009), and updated meta-analysis techniques (Rotondi and Donner, 2011).</li>
<li><pkg>dfcrm</pkg> This package provides functions to run the CRM and
TITE-CRM in phase I trials and calibration tools for trial planning purposes.</li>

<li><pkg>Experiment</pkg> contains tools for clinical experiments, e.g., a
randomization tool, and it provides a few special analysis options for clinical
trials.</li>
<li><pkg>FrF2</pkg> This package creates regular and non-regular Fractional Factorial designs. Furthermore, analysis tools for Fractional Factorial designs with 2-level factors are offered (main effects and interaction plots for all factors simultaneously, cube plot for looking at the simultaneous effects of three factors, full or half normal plot, alias structure in a more readable format than with the built-in function alias). The package is currently subject to intensive development. While much of the intended functionality is already available, some changes and improvements are still to be expected.</li>
<li><pkg>GroupSeq</pkg> performs computations related to group sequential
designs via the alpha spending approach, i.e., interim analyses need not be
equally spaced, and their number need not be specified in advance.</li>

<li><pkg>gsDesign</pkg> derives group sequential designs and describes their
properties.</li> 

<li><code>ldBand</code> from <pkg>Hmisc</pkg> computes and plots group
sequential stopping boundaries from the Lan-DeMets method with a variety of
a-spending functions using the ld98 program from the Department of
Biostatistics, University of Wisconsin written by DM Reboussin, DL DeMets, KM
Kim, and KKG Lan.</li> 

<li><pkg>ldbounds</pkg> uses Lan-DeMets Method for group sequential trial; its
functions calculate bounds and probabilities of a group sequential trial.</li> 
<li><pkg>longpower</pkg> The longpower package contains functions for computing power and sample size for linear models of longitudinal data based on the formula due to Liu and Liang (1997) and Diggle et al (2002). Either formula is expressed in terms of marginal model or Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) parameters. This package contains functions which translate pilot mixed effect model parameters (e.g. random intercept and/or slope) into marginal model parameters so that the formulas of Diggle et al or Liu and Liang formula can be applied to produce sample size calculations for two sample longitudinal designs assuming known variance.</li>
<li><pkg>PIPS</pkg> is a set of tools to compute power in a group sequential
design.</li>
<li><pkg>PowerTOST</pkg> contains functions to calculate power and sample size for various study designs used for bioequivalence studies. See function known.designs() for study designs covered. Moreover the package contains functions for power and sample size based on 'expected' power in case of uncertain (estimated) variability. Added are functions for the power and sample size for the ratio of two means with normally distributed data on the original scale (based on Fieller's confidence ('fiducial') interval).</li>
<li><pkg>pwr</pkg> has power analysis functions along the lines of Cohen (1988).</li>
<li><pkg>PwrGSD</pkg> is a set of tools to compute power in a group sequential
design.</li>
<li><pkg>qtlDesign</pkg>provides tools for the design of QTL experiments.</li>
<li><pkg>samplesize</pkg> computes sample size for Student's t-test with equal and nonequal variances and for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for categorical data with and without ties.</li>
<li><pkg>seqmon</pkg> is computes the probability of crossing sequential
efficacy and futility boundaries in a clinical trial. It implements the
Armitage-McPherson and Rowe Algorithm using the method described in Schoenfeld
(2001).</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Design and Analysis</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Package <pkg>AGSDest</pkg> This library provides tools and functions for parameter estimation in adaptive group sequential trials.</li>
<li>Package <pkg>clinfun</pkg> has functions for both design and analysis of
clinical trials. For phase II trials, it has functions to calculate sample size,
effect size, and power based on Fisher's exact test, the operating
characteristics of a two-stage boundary, Optimal and Minimax 2-stage Phase II
designs given by Richard Simon, the exact 1-stage Phase II design and can
compute a stopping rule and its operating characteristics for toxicity
monitoring based repeated significance testing. For phase III trials, it can
calculate sample size for group sequential designs.</li> 
<li>Package <pkg>CRM</pkg> Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) simulator for Phase I Clinical Trials.</li>
<li>Package <pkg>DoseFinding</pkg> provides functions for the design and analysis 
of dose-finding experiments (for example pharmaceutical Phase II clinical trials). 
It provides functions for: multiple contrast tests, fitting non-linear dose-response models, 
calculating optimal designs and an implementation of the <pkg>MCPMod</pkg> methodology. 
Currently only normally distributed homoscedastic endpoints are supported.</li> 
<li><pkg>MCPMod</pkg> This package implements a methodology for the design and analysis of dose-response studies that combines aspects of multiple comparison procedures and modeling approaches (Bretz, Pinheiro and Branson, 2005, Biometrics 61, 738-748). The package provides tools for the analysis of dose finding trials as well as a variety of tools necessary to plan a trial to be conducted with the MCPMod methodology. </li>
<li><pkg>MSToolkit</pkg> This library is for evaluating clinical trial design and analysis operating characteristics through simulation.</li>
<li>Package <pkg>TEQR</pkg> The target equivalence range (TEQR) design is a frequentist implementation of the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design and a competitor to the standard 3+3 design (3+3). The 3+3 is the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The TEQR is better than the 3+3 when compared on: 1) the number of times the dose at or nearest the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD, 2) the number of subjects assigned to doses levels, at or nearest the MTD, and 3) the overall trial DLT rate. TEQR more accurately and more precisely estimates the rate of toxicity at the MTD because a larger number of subjects are studied at the MTD dose. The TEQR on average uses fewer subjects and provide reasonably comparable results to the continual reassessment method (CRM) in the number of times the dose at or nearest the target toxicity level was selected as the MTD and the number of subjects assigned doses, at, or nearest the target and in overall DLT rate.</li> 
</ul>

and trifactorial clinical trial designs using bootstrap methods and a classical
approach.</li>

<li>The package <pkg>ClinicalRobustPriors</pkg> can be employed for computing
