    <p>Base R includes many functions that can be used for reading,
    vizualising, and analysing spatial data. The focus in this view is on
    "geographical" spatial data, where observations can be identified
    with geographical locations, and where additional information about
    these locations may be retrieved if the location is recorded with
    care. Base R functions are complemented by contributed packages,
    some of which are on CRAN, and others on the
    <a target="_top" href="http://R-spatial.sourceforge.net/">R-spatial</a>
    sourceforge repository. The
    contributed packages address two broad areas: moving spatial data
    into and out of R, and analysing spatial data in R.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/R-SIG-Geo/">R-SIG-Geo</a>
    mailing-list is a good place to begin for obtaining help and discussing
    questions about both accessing data, and analysing it. More
    information about the functions is available from the
    <a target="_top" href="http://www.R-project.org/Rgeo/">Rgeo</a> website. The packages in this
    view can be roughly structured into the following topics. If you think
    that some package is missing from the list, please let me know.</p>
    <ul>

      <li><p><b>Classes for spatial data</b>: Because many of the
      packages importing and using spatial data have had to include
      objects of storing data and functions for vizualising it,
      an initiative is in progress to construct shared classes
      and plotting functions for spatial data. The <pkg>sp</pkg>
      package has been published on CRAN, and wrapper packages
      are available from a repository for work in progress at the
      <a href="http://R-spatial.sourceforge.net/">R-spatial</a>
      Sourceforge home page. The <pkg>sp</pkg> package is discussed in a note in
      <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2005-2.pdf">R
      News</a>.  Some other packages have become dependent on these
      classes, including <pkg>rgdal</pkg> and <pkg>maptools</pkg>. An
      alternative approach to some of these issues is implemented in
      the <pkg>PBSmapping</pkg> package; <pkg>PBSmodelling</pkg> provides modelling support.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Handling spatial data</b>: A number of packages have
      been written using sp classes. The <pkg>spsurvey</pkg> provides a
      range of sampling functions. The <pkg>trip</pkg> package extends sp
      classes to permit the accessing and manipulating of spatial data
      for animal tracking. The <pkg>hdeco</pkg> package provides hierarchical decomposition of entropy for categorical map comparisons. The <pkg>GeoXP</pkg> package permits interactive graphical exploratory spatial data analysis.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Reading and writing spatial data</b>: Maps may be
      vector-based or raster-based. The <pkg>rgdal</pkg> package provides
      bindings to <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL</a>-supported raster
      formats and <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr/">OGR</a>-supported
      vector formats. It contains functions to write raster
      files in supported formats. The package also provides <a
      href="http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/">PROJ.4</a> projection
      support for vector objects. The Windows binary of <pkg>rgdal</pkg>
      includes a subset of possible data source drivers; if others
      are needed, use FWTools conversion utilities; for NetCDF files, <pkg>ncdf</pkg> may be used. There are a
      number of other packages for accessing vector data on CRAN:
      <pkg>maps</pkg> (with <pkg>mapdata</pkg> and <pkg>mapproj</pkg>)
      provides access to the same kinds of geographical databases as
      S, <pkg>RArcInfo</pkg> allows ArcInfo v.7 binary files and *.e00
      files to be read, and <pkg>maptools</pkg> and <pkg>shapefiles</pkg>
      read and write ArcGIS/ArcView shapefiles. The <pkg>maptools</pkg>
      package also provides helper functions for writing map polygon
      files to be read by WinBUGS, Mondrian, and the tmap command
      in Stata. It also provides interface functions between
      <pkg>PBSmapping</pkg> and <pkg>spatstat</pkg> and sp classes,
      in addition to <pkg>maps</pkg> databases and sp classes. There is
      also an interface to GSHHS shoreline databases. For visualization,
      the colour palettes provided in
      the <pkg>RColorBrewer</pkg> package are very useful, and may
      be modified or extended using the <code>colorRampPalette</code>
      function provided with R. The <pkg>classInt</pkg> package provides
      functions for choosing class intervals for thematic cartography.
      The <pkg>gmt</pkg> package gives a simple interface between GMT map-making software and R. </p>

      <p>Integration with version 6.* of the leading open source
      GIS, GRASS, is provided in CRAN package <pkg>spgrass6</pkg>, using
      <pkg>rgdal</pkg> and <pkg>maptools</pkg> for exchanging data.
      Integration with legacy version 5.* GRASS, continues to be provided
      in CRAN package <pkg>GRASS</pkg>.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Point pattern analysis</b>: The <pkg>spatial</pkg>
      package is available as part of the <pkg>VR</pkg> bundle
      (shipped with base R), and contains several core functions. In
      addition, <pkg>spatstat</pkg> allows freedom in defining the
      region(s) of interest, and makes extensions to marked processes
      and spatial covariates. Its strengths are model-fitting and
      simulation, and it has a useful <a href="http://www.spatstat.org/">
      homepage</a>. It is the only package that will enable the user to fit
      inhomogeneous point process models with interpoint interactions. The <pkg>spatgraphs</pkg> package provides graphs, graph visualization and graph based summaries to be used with spatial point pattern analysis. The
      <pkg>splancs</pkg> package also allows point data to be analysed
      within a polygonal region of interest, and covers many methods,
      including 2D kernel densities. <pkg>ecespa</pkg> provides wrappers, functions and data for for spatial point pattern analysis, used in the book on Spatial Ecology of the ECESPA/AEET. The functions for binning points
      on grids in <pkg>ash</pkg> may also be of interest. The <pkg>ads</pkg> package perform first- and second-order multi-scale analyses derived from Ripley's K-function. The <pkg>aspace</pkg> package is a collection of functions for estimating centrographic statistcs and computational geometries from spatial point patterns. <pkg>spatialkernel</pkg> provides edge-corrected kernel density estimation and binary kernel regression estimation for multivariate spatial point process data.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Geostatistics</b>: The <pkg>gstat</pkg> package provides
      a wide range of functions for univariate and multivariate
      geostatistics, also for larger datasets, while <pkg>geoR</pkg>
      and <pkg>geoRglm</pkg> contain functions for model-based
      geostatistics. A similar wide range of functions is to be
      found in the <pkg>fields</pkg> package. The <pkg>spatial</pkg>
      package is available as part of the <pkg>VR</pkg> bundle
      (shipped with base R), and contains several core functions. The <pkg>spBayes</pkg> package fits Gaussian univariate and multivariate models with MCMC.</p>

      <p> The <pkg>RandomFields</pkg> package provides functions for
      the simulation and analysis of random fields, and variogram model descriptions can be passed between <pkg>geoR</pkg>, <pkg>gstat</pkg> and this package. For diagnostics
      of variograms, the <pkg>vardiag</pkg> package can be used. The
      <pkg>sgeostat</pkg> package is also available. Within the same
      general topical area are the <pkg>tripack</pkg> for triangulation
      and the <pkg>akima</pkg> package for spline interpolation. In
      addition, there are the <pkg>spatialCovariance</pkg> package,
      which supports the computation of spatial covariance matrices
      for data on rectangles, the <pkg>regress</pkg> package building
      in part on <pkg>spatialCovariance</pkg>, and the <pkg>tgp</pkg>
      package.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>Disease mapping and areal data analysis</b>:
      <pkg>DCluster</pkg> is a package for the detection of
      spatial clusters of diseases. It extends and  depends on the
      <pkg>spdep</pkg> package, which provides basic functions for
      building neighbour lists and spatial weights, tests for spatial
      autocorrelation for areal data like Moran's I, and functions for
      fitting spatial regression models, such as SAR and CAR models. These
      models assume that the spatial dependence can be described by known
      weights. The <pkg>spgwr</pkg> package contains an implementation of
      geographically weighted regression methods for exploring possible
      non-stationarity. The <pkg>spatclus</pkg> package provides arbitrarily shaped multiple spatial cluster detection for case event data. </p></li>

      <li><p><b>Ecological analysis</b>: There are many packages
      for analysing ecological and environmental data. They include
      <pkg>grasp</pkg> for environmental prediction using GAM,
      <pkg>ade4</pkg> for exploratory and Euclidean methods in the
      environmental sciences, <pkg>adehabitat</pkg> for the analysis of
      habitat selection by animals, <pkg>pastecs</pkg> for the regulation,
      decomposition and analysis of space-time series, <pkg>vegan</pkg>
      for ordination methods and other useful functions for community and
      vegetation ecologists, and many other functions in other contributed
      packages. <pkg>WeedMap</pkg> is a recent contribution for computing spatial predictions from exact count and a covariate. An off-CRAN package - <a href="http://www.leg.ufpr.br/Rcitrus/">Rcitrus</a> - is for the spatial analysis of plant disease incidence. <pkg>clustTool</pkg> is a GUI for clustering data with spatial information.The <a href="Environmetrics.html">Environmetrics</a> Task
      View contains a much more complete survey of relevant functions
      and packages.</p></li>
