<info> This CRAN task view contains a list of packages that includes
methods typically used in official statistics and survey methodology.
Many packages provide functionality for more than one of the topics listed 
below.  Therefore this list is not a strict categorization and packages can be 
listed more than once.  Please note that not all topics that are of interest in 
official statistics are listed below, because functionality in R might be 
missing until now.
 

<p><strong>Complex Survey Design: General Comments</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Package <pkg>sampling</pkg> includes many different algorithms for 
  drawing survey samples and calibrating the design weights.  
  </li>
  <li> Package <pkg>survey</pkg> can also handle moderate data sets and is the 
  standard package for dealing with already drawn survey samples in R.  Once 
  the given survey design is specified within the function 
  <code>svydesign()</code>, point and variance estimates can be computed.
  </li>
  <li> Package <pkg>simFrame</pkg> is designed for performing simulation 
  studies in official statistics.  It provides a framework for comparing 
  different point and variance estimators under different survey designs as 
  well as different conditions regarding missing values, representative and 
  non-representative outliers.
  </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Complex Survey Design: Details</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>survey</pkg> allows to specify a complex survey design 
  (stratified sampling design, cluster sampling, multi-stage sampling and pps 
  sampling with or without replacement) for an already drawn survey sample in 
  order to compute accurate point and variance estimates.
  </li>
  <li>
  Various algorithms for drawing a sample are implemented in package 
  <pkg>sampling</pkg> (Brewer, Midzuno, pps, systematic, Sampford, balanced 
  (cluster or stratified) sampling via the cube method, etc.).
  </li>
  <!--
  <li>
  Package <pkg>simFrame</pkg> includes a fast (compiled C-Code) version of 
  Midzuno sampling. 
  </li>
  -->
  <li>
  The <pkg>pps</pkg> package contains functions to select samples using pps 
  sampling.  Also stratified simple random sampling is possible as well as to 
  compute joint inclusion probabilities for Sampford's method of pps sampling. 
  </li>
  <li> Package <pkg>sampfling</pkg> implements the Sampford algorithm to obtain 
  a sample without replacement and with unequal probabilities. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>stratification</pkg> allows univariate stratification of survey 
  populations with a generalisation of the Lavallee-Hidiroglou method.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>SamplingStrata</pkg> offers an approach for choosing the best 
  stratification of a sampling frame in a multivariate and multidomain setting, 
  where the sampling sizes in each strata are determined in order to satisfy accuracy 
  constraints on target estimates.
To evaluate the distribution of target variables in different strata, information of the sampling frame, 
or data from previous rounds of the same survey, may be used.
  </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Complex Survey Design: Point and Variance Estimation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>survey</pkg> allows to specify a complex survey design. The 
  resulting object can be used to estimate (Horvitz-Thompson-) totals, means, 
  ratios and quantiles for domains or the whole survey sample, and to apply 
  regression models.  Variance estimation for means, totals and ratios can be 
  done either by Taylor linearization or resampling (BRR, jackkife, bootstrap 
  or user-defined).
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>EVER</pkg> provides the estimation of variance for complex 
  designs by delete-a-group jackknife replication for (Horvitz-Thompson-) 
  totals, means, absolute and relative frequency distributions, contingency 
  tables, ratios, quantiles and regression coefficients even for domains.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>laeken</pkg> provides functions to estimate certain Laeken 
  indicators (at-risk-of-poverty rate, quintile share ratio, relative median 
  risk-of-poverty gap, Gini coefficient) including their variance for domains 
  and stratas based on bootstrap resampling. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>simFrame</pkg> allows to compare (user-defined) point and 
  variance estimators in a simulation environment. 
  </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Complex Survey Design: Calibration</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>survey</pkg> allows for post-stratification, generalized 
  raking/calibration, GREG estimation and trimming of weights. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>EVER</pkg> provide facilities (function 
  <code>kottcalibrate()</code>) to calibrate either on a total number of units 
  in the population, on mariginal distributions or joint distributions of 
  categorical variables, or on totals of quantitative variables. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The <code>calib()</code> function in Package <pkg>sampling</pkg> allows to 
  calibrate for nonresponse (with response homogeneity groups) for stratified 
  samples.
  </li>
  <li>
  The <code>calibWeights()</code> function in package <pkg>laeken</pkg> is a 
  possible faster (depending on the example) implementation of parts of <code>calib()</code> from package 
  <pkg>sampling</pkg>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>reweight</pkg> allows for calibration of survey weights for 
  categorical survey data so that the marginal distributions of certain 
  variables fit more closely to those from a given population, but does not 
  allow complex sampling designs. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Editing and Visual Inspection of Microdata</strong></p>
<p>Editing tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    Package <pkg>editrules</pkg> convert readable linear (in)equalities into matrix form.
  </li>
  <li> 
Package <pkg>deducorrect</pkg> depends on package <pkg>editrules</pkg> and applies deductive correction of simple rounding, typing and
                    sign errors based on balanced edits. Values are changed so that the given balanced edits are fulfilled. To determine which values are changed the Levenstein-metric is applied.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>SeleMix</pkg> can be used for selective editing for continuous scaled data. 
  A mixture model (Gaussian contamination model) based on response(s) y and a depended set of covariates is fit to the data to 
  quantify the impact of errors to the estimates.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>rrcovNA</pkg> provides robust location and scatter estimation and robust
                    principal component analysis with high breakdown point for
                    incomplete data. It is therefore 
                    applicable to find representative and non-representative outliers.
  </li>
</ul>  
<p>Visual tools:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    Package <pkg>VIM</pkg> is designed to visualize missing values 
  using suitable plot methods. It can be used to analyse the structure of missing values in microdata using univariate, bivariate, multiple and multivariate plots where the  
  information of missing values 
  from specified variables are highlighted in selected variables. 
  It also comes with a graphical user interface.  
   </li>
     <li> 
   Package <pkg>tabplot</pkg>  provides the tableplot visualization method, which is used to profile or explore large statistical datasets. 
   Up to a dozen of variables are shown column-wise as bar charts (numeric variables) or stacked bar charts (factors). 
   Key aspects of the analysis with tableplots are the smoothness of a data distribution, 
   the selective occurrence of missing values, and the distribution of correlated variables.   
      </li>
</ul>
   
<p><strong>Imputation</strong></p>
A distinction between iterative model-based methods, k-nearest neighbor methods 
and miscellaneous methods is made.  However, often the criteria for using a 
method depend on the scale of the data, which in official statistics are 
typically a mixture of continuous, semi-continuous, binary, categorical and 
count variables. In addition, measurement errors may corrupt non-robust imputation methods.
Note that only few imputation methods can deal with mixed types of variables and only few methods account for robustness issues.
<p>EM-based Imputation Methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>mi</pkg> provides iterative EM-based multiple Bayesian 
  regression imputation of missing values and model checking of the regression 
  models used.  The regression models for each variable can also be
  user-defined.  The data set may consist of continuous, semi-continuous, 
  binary, categorical and/or count variables.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>mice</pkg> provides iterative EM-based multiple regression 
  imputation.  The data set may consist of continuous, binary, categorical 
  and/or count variables. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>mitools</pkg> provides tools to perform analyses and combine 
  results from multiply-imputated datasets.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>Amelia</pkg> provides multiple imputation where first bootstrap 
  samples with the same dimensions as the original data are drawn, and then 
  used for EM-based imputation.  It is also possible to impute longitudial 
  data.  The package in addition comes with a graphical user interface. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>VIM</pkg> provides EM-based multiple imputation (function 
  <code>irmi()</code>) using robust estimations, which allows to adequately 
  deal with data including outliers.  It can handle data consisting of 
  continuous, semi-continuous, binary, categorical and/or count variables.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>mix</pkg> provides iterative EM-based multiple regression 
  imputation.  The data set may consist of continuous, binary or categorical 
  variables, but methods for semi-continuous variables are missing.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>pan</pkg> provides multiple imputation for multivariate panel or 
  clustered data.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>norm</pkg> provides EM-based multiple imputation for 
  multivariate normal data.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>cat</pkg> provides EM-based multiple imputation for multivariate 
  categorical data.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>MImix</pkg> provides tools to combine results for 
  multiply-imputed data using mixture approximations.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>robCompositions</pkg> provides iterative model-based imputation 
  for compositional data (function <code>impCoda()</code>). 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Nearest Neighbor Imputation Methods</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>VIM</pkg> provides an implementation of the popular 
  sequential and random (within a domain) hot-deck algorithm.  
  </li> 
  <li>
  <pkg>VIM</pkg> also provides a fast k-nearest neighbor (knn) algorithm which can be used for large data sets.
  It uses a modification of the Gower Distance for numerical, categorical, ordered, continuous and semi-continous variables.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>yaImpute</pkg> performs popular nearest neighbor routines for 
  imputation of continuous variables where different metrics and methods can be 
  used for determining the distance between observations.
  </li>
  <li>
  Function <code>SeqKNN()</code> in Package <pkg>SeqKnn</pkg> imputes the 
  missing values in continuously scaled variables sequentially.  First, it 
  separates the dataset into incomplete and complete observations.  The 
  observations in the incomplete set are imputed by the order of missing rate.  
  Once the missing values in an observations are imputed, the imputed 
  observation is moved into the complete set. It can only applied to continuous scaled variables.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>robCompositions</pkg> provides knn imputation for 
  compositional data (function <code>impKNNa()</code>) using the Aitchison 
  distance and adjustment of the nearest neighbor. 
  </li>
  <li> 
  Package <pkg>rrcovNA</pkg> provides an algorithm for (robust) sequential imputation (function 
  <code>impSeq()</code> and <code>impSeqRob()</code>  
  by minimizing the determinant of the covariance of the augmented data matrix. It's application is limited to continuous scaled data.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <bioc>impute</bioc> on Bioconductor impute provides knn imputation of continuous 
  variables.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Miscellaneous Imputation Methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>missMDA</pkg> allows to impute incomplete continuous variables 
  by principal component analysis (PCA) or categorical variables by multiple 
  correspondence analysis (MCA).
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>mice</pkg> (function <code>mice.impute.pmm()</code>) and 
  Package <pkg>Hmisc</pkg> (function <code>aregImpute()</code>) allow 
  predicitve mean matching imputation.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>VIM</pkg> allows to visualize the structure of missing values 
  using suitable plot methods.  It also comes with a graphical user interface.
  </li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Statistical Disclosure Control</strong></p>
Data from statistical agencies and other institutions are in its raw form 
mostly confidential and data providers have to be ensure confidentiality by 
both modifying the original data so that no statistical units can be 
re-identified and by guaranting a minimum amount of information loss.
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>sdcMicro</pkg> can be used for the generation of confidential 
  (micro)data, i.e. for the generation of public- and scientific-use files.  
  The package also comes with a graphical user interface.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>simPopulation</pkg> simulates synthetic, confidential, close-to-reality populations for 
  surveys based on sample data. Such population data can then be used for 
  extensive simulation studies in official statistics, using <pkg>simFrame</pkg> for example.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>sdcTable</pkg>  can be used to provide confidential 
  (hierarchical) tabular data.  It includes the HITAS and the HYPERCUBE 
  technique and uses package <pkg>lpSolve</pkg> for solving (a large amount of) 
  linear programs.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Seasonal Adjustment</strong></p>
For general time series methodology we refer to the 
<view>TimeSeries</view> task view. 
<ul>
  <li>
  Decomposition of time series can be done with the function 
  <code>decompose()</code>, or more advanced by using the function 
  <code>stl()</code>, both from the basic <pkg>stats</pkg> package.  
  Decomposition is also possible with the <code>StructTS()</code> function, 
  which can also be found in the <pkg>stats</pkg> package.
  </li>
  <li>
  Many powerful tools can be accessed via package <pkg>x12</pkg>.  It provides 
  a wrapper function and GUI for the 
  <a href="http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/">X12 binaries</a> under 
  windows, which have to be installed first.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Statistical Record Matching</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>StatMatch</pkg> provides functions to perform statistical 
  matching between two data sources sharing a number of common variables. It 
  creates a synthetic data set after matching of two data sources via a 
  likelihood aproach or via hot-deck.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>RecordLinkage</pkg> provides functions for linking and 
  deduplicating data sets. 
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>MatchIt</pkg> allows nearest neighbor matching, exact matching, optimal matching and full matching amonst
  other matching methods. If two data sets have to be matched, the data must come as one data frame including a factor
  variable which includes information about the membership of each observation.
  </li>
</ul>  

<p><strong>Indices and Indicators</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>laeken</pkg> provides functions to estimate popular 
  risk-of-poverty and inequality indicators (at-risk-of-poverty rate, quintile 
  share ratio, relative median risk-of-poverty gap, Gini coefficient). 
  In addition, standard and robust methods for tail modeling of Pareto 
  distributions are provided for semi-parametric estimation of indicators
  from continuous univariate distributions such as income variables.
  </li>
  <li>
  Package <pkg>ineq</pkg> computes various inequality measures (Gini, Theil,
  entropy, among others), concentration measures (Herfindahl, Rosenbluth), and poverty
  measures (Watts, Sen, SST, and Foster). It also computes and draws empirical and theoretical
  Lorenz curves as well as Pen's parade. It is not designed to deal with sampling weights directly
  (these could only be emulated via <code>rep(x, weights)</code>). 
  </li>
  <li>
  Function <code>priceIndex()</code> from package <pkg>micEcon</pkg> allows to 
  estimate the Paasche, the Fisher and the Laspeyres price indices.
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
  <li>
  The <pkg>FFD</pkg> package is designed to calculate optimal sample sizes of a population of animals 
  living in herds for surveys to substantiate freedom from disease. 
  The criteria of estimating the sample sizes take the herd-level clustering of 
  diseases as well as imperfect diagnostic tests into account and select the samples 
  based on a two-stage design. The package provides a graphical user interface as well.
