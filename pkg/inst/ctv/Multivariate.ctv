    <p>Base R contains most of the functionality for classical multivariate analysis,
       somewhere. There are a large number of packages on CRAN which extend this methodology,
       a brief overview is given below. Application-specific uses of multivariate statistics
       are described in relevant task views, for example whilst principal components are listed here, 
       ordination is covered in the <view>Environmetrics</view> task view.   Further information on supervised classification can be found in the <view>MachineLearning</view> task view, and unsupervised classification in the <view>Cluster</view> task view.</p>

       <p>The packages in this view can be roughly structured into the following topics.
       If you think that some package is missing from the list, please let me know.</p>
    
          <p><strong>Visualising multivariate data</strong>
          <ul>
          <li><i>Graphical Procedures:</i> A range of base graphics (e.g. <tt>pairs()</tt> and <tt>coplot()</tt>) and 
          <pkg>lattice</pkg> functions (e.g. <tt>xyplot()</tt> and <tt>splom()</tt>) are useful for
	  visualising pairwise arrays of 2-dimensional scatterplots, clouds and 3-dimensional densities.   
<tt>scatterplot.matrix</tt> in the <pkg>car</pkg> provides usefully enhanced pairwise scatterplots.
	  cwhplot in the <pkg>cwhmisc</pkg> bundle provides <tt>plotSplomT()</tt> which displays correlation values and adds histograms on the diagonal of scatterplot matrices.  	
        Beyond this, <pkg>scatterplot3d</pkg>
	  provides 3 dimensional scatterplots, 
<pkg>aplpack</pkg> provides bagplots and <tt>spin3R()</tt>,
          a function for rotating 3d clouds.   <pkg>misc3d</pkg>, dependent upon <pkg>rgl</pkg>,
	  provides animated functions within R useful for visualising densities.   <pkg>YaleToolkit</pkg> provides a range of useful visualisation techniques for multivariate data, as does <pkg>agsemisc</pkg>.

          visual display of a correlation matrix.   <pkg>denpro</pkg> provides level set trees
