        Great advances have been made in the field of genetic analysis over the last years. The availability of millions
    of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in widely available databases, coupled with major advances in SNP genotyping
    technology that reduce costs and increase throughput, are enabling a host of studies aimed at elucidating the genetic basis
    of complex disease. The focus in this task view is on R packages implementing statistical methods and algorithms for the
    analysis of genetic data and for related population genetics studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of R packages are already available and many more are most likely to be developed in the near future.

      and a phenotype.
<pkg>gap</pkg>
          is a package for genetic data analysis of both population and family data;
it contains functions for sample size calculations, probability of familial disease aggregation, kinship calculation,
and some tests for linkage and association analyses. Among the other functions,
          <tt>
            genecounting()
          </tt>
          estimates haplotype frequencies from genotype data, and

      With recent technical advances in high-throughput genotyping technologies the possibility of performing 
Genome-Wide Association (GWA) analyses is now a feasible strategy.  A number of packages are available to facilitate
the analysis of these large data sets.

 association with binary and quantitative traits, as well as tools for visualizing results.

          provides a GUI to the powerful PBAT software which performs family and population based family and 
population based studies.  The software has been implemented to take advantage of parallel processing, which vastly
 reduces the computational time required for GWA's.

          is another package for carrying out GWA analysis.  It provides descriptive statistics of the data 
(inlcuding patterns of missing data) and tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Single-point analyses with binary or
 quantitative traits are implemented via generalized linear models, and multiple SNPs can be anlaysed for haplotypic
 associations or epistasis.
