        Great advances have been made in the field of genetic analysis over the last years. The availability of millions
        of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in widely available databases, coupled with major advances in SNP genotyping
        technology that reduce costs and increase throughput, are enabling a host of studies aimed at elucidating the genetic basis
        of complex disease. The focus in this task view is on R packages implementing statistical methods and algorithms for the
        analysis of genetic data and for related population genetics studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of R packages are already available and many more are most likely to be developed in the near future.
        Please send your comments and suggestions to the task view maintainer.

          </i>:
<pkg>genetics</pkg>
          implements classes and methods for representing genotype and haplotype data, and has several
          functions for population genetic analysis (e.g. functions for estimation and testing of

          <i>
            Linkage
          </i>:
          There are few native packages for performing parametric or non-parametric linkage analysis 
          from within R itself, the calculations must be performed using external packages.  However,
          there are a number of ancillary R packages that facilitate interface with these stand-alone
          programs and using the results for further analysis and presentation.
<pkg>ibdreg</pkg>
          uses Identity By Descent (IBD) Non-Parametric Linkage (NPL) statistics for related pairs calculated
          externally to test for genetic linkage with covariates by regression modelling. 
<pkg>multic</pkg>
          also utilises IBD sharing statistics calculated externally for detecting quantitative trait loci
          under polygenic and major gene models via variance components.
<pkg>lodplot</pkg>
          provides routines for plotting and visualising genome-wide linkage studies.  Whilst not 
          official R packages one software suite in particular is worthy of mention.

  PLINK
</a>
          is a C++ program for genome wide linkage analysis that supports R-based plug-ins via Rserve allowing
          users to utilise the rich suite of statistical functions in R for analysis.

        <li>
          <i>
            QTL mapping

          size calculations, probability of familial disease aggregation, kinship calculation, and some tests for linkage
          and association analyses. Among the other functions,

        <li>
          <i>
            Linkage Disequilibrium and haplotype mapping
          </i>:
          A number of packages provide haplotype estimation for unrelated individuals with amnbiguous haplotypes 
          (due to unkown linkage phase) and allow testing for associations between the estimated haplotypes and
          phenotypes (including co-variates) under a GLM framework.

          association as well as providing novel functionality for building haplotypes in a sequential manner, 
          power and sample-size calculations and the preparation of data matrices for use in other methods.

            Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
          </i>:
          With recent technical advances in high-throughput genotyping technologies the possibility of performing 
          Genome-Wide Association Studies is now a feasible strategy.  A number of packages are available to facilitate
          the analysis of these large data sets.
<pkg>GenAbel</pkg> 
          is designed for the efficent storage and handling of GWAS data with fast analysis tools for quality control,
          association with binary and quantitative traits, as well as tools for visualizing results.
<pkg>pbatR</pkg>
          provides a GUI to the powerful PBAT software which performs family and population based family and 
          population based studies.  The software has been implemented to take advantage of parallel processing, which
          vastly reduces the computational time required for GWAS.
<pkg>SNPassoc</pkg>
          is another package for carrying out GWAS analysis.  It provides descriptive statistics of the data 
          (inlcuding patterns of missing data) and tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Single-point analyses with binary 
          or quantitative traits are implemented via generalized linear models, and multiple SNPs can be anlaysed for 
          haplotypic associations or epistasis.
<pkg>snpMatrix</pkg>

          <i>
            Importing Sequence Data
          </i>:
          There are utilities in the
<pkg>seqinr</pkg>
          package to import sequence data from various sources, including files of aligned sequences in mase, clustal,
          phylip, fasta and msf format which will be of utility to some population genetic analysis.  Users interested in
          using R for sequence data and bioinformatics are also referred to the
