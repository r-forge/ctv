      <p>
        Great advances have been made in the field of genetic analysis over the last years. The availability of millions
        of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in widely available databases, coupled with major advances in SNP genotyping
        technology that reduce costs and increase throughput, are enabling a host of studies aimed at elucidating the genetic basis
        of complex disease. The focus in this task view is on R packages implementing statistical methods and algorithms for the
        analysis of genetic data and for related population genetics studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of R packages are already available and many more are most likely to be developed in the near future.
        Please send your comments and suggestions to the task view maintainer.

          <i>
            Population Genetics
          </i>:
<pkg>genetics</pkg>
          implements classes and methods for representing genotype and haplotype data, and has several
          functions for population genetic analysis (e.g. functions for estimation and testing of 
          Hardy-Weinberg and linkage disequilibria, etc.).
<pkg>rmetasim</pkg>
          provides an interface to the metasim engine
      for population genetics simulations.
          A few population genetics functions are also implemeted in
<pkg>gap</pkg>.
<pkg>LDheatmap</pkg>
          creates a heat map plot of measures of pairwise LD.
<pkg>hwde</pkg>
          fits models for genotypic disequilibria.  Whilst
<pkg>HardyWeinberg</pkg>
          provides graphical representation of disequilibria via ternary plots (also known as de Finetti diagrams).
<pkg>Biodem</pkg>
          package provides functions for Biodemographical analysis, e.g.
          <code>
            Fst()
          </code>
          calculates the Fst from the conditional kinship matrix. The
<pkg>adegenet</pkg> package implements a number of different methods for analysing population structure using multivariate
          statistics, graphics and spatial statistics.
The <pkg>hierfstat</pkg> package allows the estimation of hierarchical F-statistics from haploid or diploid genetic data with any numbers of levels in the hierarchy.

	  The <view>Phylogenetics</view> view has more detailed information,
	  the most important packages are also mentioned here.	  
          Phylogenetic and evolution analyses can be performed via
<pkg>ape</pkg>. Package
<pkg>ouch</pkg>
          provides Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models for phylogenetic comparative hypotheses.

          <i>
            Linkage
          </i>:
          There are few native packages for performing parametric or non-parametric linkage analysis 
          from within R itself, the calculations must be performed using external packages.  However,
          there are a number of ancillary R packages that facilitate interface with these stand-alone
          programs and using the results for further analysis and presentation.
<pkg>ibdreg</pkg>
          uses Identity By Descent (IBD) Non-Parametric Linkage (NPL) statistics for related pairs calculated
          externally to test for genetic linkage with covariates by regression modelling. 
Whilst not official R packages one software suite in particular is worthy of mention.
<a href="http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/">
  PLINK
</a>
          is a C++ program for genome wide linkage analysis that supports R-based plug-ins via Rserve allowing
          users to utilise the rich suite of statistical functions in R for analysis.

          </code>
          for genome-wide scans.
<pkg>wgaim</pkg>
          builds on the <pkg>qtl</pkg> by including functions for the modelling and summary of QTL intervals from the
          full linkage map whilst
<pkg>dlmap</pkg>
          can be used to perform QTL mapping in a mixed model framework with separate detection and localization stages.

          and a phenotype.
<pkg>gap</pkg>
          is a package for genetic data analysis of both population and family data; it contains functions for sample 
          size calculations, probability of familial disease aggregation, kinship calculation, and some tests for linkage
          and association analyses. Among the other functions,
          <code>
            genecounting()
          </code>
          estimates haplotype frequencies from genotype data, and
          <code>
            gcontrol()
          </code>
          implements a Bayesian genomic control statistics for association studies. For family data,

            Linkage Disequilibrium and haplotype mapping
          </i>:
          A number of packages provide haplotype estimation for unrelated individuals with amnbiguous haplotypes 
          (due to unkown linkage phase) and allow testing for associations between the estimated haplotypes and
          phenotypes (including co-variates) under a GLM framework.
<pkg>hapassoc</pkg>
          performs likelihood inference of trait associations with haplotypes in GLMs.

            Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
          </i>:
          With recent technical advances in high-throughput genotyping technologies the possibility of performing 
          Genome-Wide Association Studies is now a feasible strategy.  A number of packages are available to facilitate
          the analysis of these large data sets.
<pkg>GenABEL</pkg> 
          is designed for the efficent storage and handling of GWAS data with fast analysis tools for quality control,
          association with binary and quantitative traits, as well as tools for visualizing results.
<pkg>pbatR</pkg>
          provides a GUI to the powerful PBAT software which performs family and population based family and 
          population based studies.  The software has been implemented to take advantage of parallel processing, which
          vastly reduces the computational time required for GWAS.
<!-- <pkg>SNPassoc</pkg>
          is another package for carrying out GWAS analysis.  It provides descriptive statistics of the data 
          (inlcuding patterns of missing data) and tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Single-point analyses with binary 
          or quantitative traits are implemented via generalized linear models, and multiple SNPs can be anlaysed for 
          haplotypic associations or epistasis. -->

<pkg>seqinr</pkg>
          package to import sequence data from various sources, including files of aligned sequences in mase, clustal,
