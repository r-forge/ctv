    <p>Base R ships with a lot of functionality useful for computational
    econometrics, in particular in the stats package. This
    functionality is complemented by many packages on CRAN, a brief overview
    is given below. There is also a considerable overlap between the tools
    for econometrics in this view and for finance in the <view>Finance</view> view.
    Furthermore, the 
    <a href="https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/R-SIG-Finance/">Finance SIG</a>    
    is a suitable mailing list for obtaining help
    and discussing questions about both computational finance and econometrics.
    Finally, there is also some overlap with the <view>SocialSciences</view> that
    also covers a broad variety of tools for social sciences, e.g., including political science.</p>
    
    <p>The packages in this view can be roughly structured into the following topics.
    If you think that some package is missing from the list, please let me know.</p>

    <p><strong>Linear regression models</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Linear models can be fitted (via OLS) with <code>lm()</code>
          (from stats) and standard tests for model comparisons are available in various
	  methods such as <code>summary()</code> and <code>anova()</code>.</li>
      <li>Analogous functions
	  that also support asymptotic tests (<i>z</i> instead of <i>t</i> tests, and
	  Chi-squared instead of <i>F</i> tests) and plug-in of other covariance
	  matrices are <code>coeftest()</code> and <code>waldtest()</code> in <pkg>lmtest</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Tests of more general linear hypotheses are implemented in <code>linear.hypothesis()</code>
	  in <pkg>car</pkg>.</li>
      <li>HC and HAC covariance matrices that can be plugged
	  into these functions are available in <pkg>sandwich</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Diagnost checking: The packages
	  <pkg>car</pkg> and <pkg>lmtest</pkg> provide a large collection
	  of regression diagonstics and diagnostic tests.</li>
      <li>Instrumental variables regression (two-stage least squares) is
	  provided by <code>ivreg()</code> in <pkg>AER</pkg>, another implementation
	  is <code>tsls()</code> in package <pkg>sem</pkg>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Microeconometrics</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Many standard microeconometric models belong to the
          family of generalized linear models (GLM) and can be fitted by <code>glm()</code>
	  from package stats. This includes in particular logit and probit models
	  for modeling choice data and poisson models for count data. Effects for typical
	  values of regressors in these models can be obtained and visualized using <pkg>effects</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Negative binomial GLMs are available via <code>glm.nb()</code> in package <pkg>MASS</pkg>.
	  Another implementation of negative binomial models
	  is provided by <pkg>aod</pkg>, which also contains other models for overdispersed
	  data.</li>
      <li>Zero-inflated and hurdle count models are provided in package <pkg>pscl</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Multinomial responses: Multinomial models
	  with individual-specific covariates only are available in <code>multinom()</code>
	  from package <pkg>nnet</pkg>. An implementation with both individual- and
	  choice-specific variables is <pkg>mlogit</pkg>. Generalized additive models
	  (GAMs) for multinomial responses can be fitted with the <pkg>VGAM</pkg> package.	  
	  A Bayesian approach to multinomial probit models is provided by <pkg>MNP</pkg>.
	  Various Bayesian multinomial models (including logit and probit) are available
	  in <pkg>bayesm</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Ordered responses: Proportional-odds regression for ordered responses is implemented
          in <code>polr()</code> from package <pkg>MASS</pkg>. The package <pkg>ordinal</pkg>
	  provides cumulative link models for ordered data which encompasses proportional
	  odds models but also includes more general specifications. Bayesian ordered probit
	  models are provided by <pkg>bayesm</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Censored responses: Basic censored regression models (e.g., tobit models)
	  can be fitted by <code>survreg()</code> in <pkg>survival</pkg>, a convenience
	  interface <code>tobit()</code> is in package <pkg>AER</pkg>. Further censored
	  regression models, including models for panel data, are provided in <pkg>censReg</pkg>.
	  Interval regression models are in <pkg>intReg</pkg>.
	  Furthermore, hurdle models for left-censored data at zero can be estimated with
	  <pkg>mhurdle</pkg>. Models for sample selection are available in <pkg>sampleSelection</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Multivariate probit models: Estimation and marginal effect computations can be
          carried out with <pkg>mvProbit</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Miscellaneous: Further more refined tools for microecnometrics are provided in
	  the <pkg>micEcon</pkg> family of packages: Analysis with
	  Cobb-Douglas, translog, and quadratic functions is in <pkg>micEcon</pkg>;
	  the constant elasticity of scale (CES) function is in <pkg>micEconCES</pkg>;
	  the symmetric normalized quadratic profit (SNQP) function is in <pkg>micEconSNQP</pkg>.
          The almost ideal demand system (AIDS) is in <pkg>micEconAids</pkg>.	  
	  Stochastic frontier analysis is in <pkg>frontier</pkg>.
	  The package <pkg>bayesm</pkg> implements a Bayesian
	  approach to microeconometrics and marketing. Inference for relative
	  distributions is contained in package <pkg>reldist</pkg>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Further regression models</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Nonlinear least squares modeling is availble in <code>nls()</code>
	  in package stats.</li>
      <li>Quantile regression: <pkg>quantreg</pkg> (including linear, nonlinear, censored,
          locally polynomial and additive quantile regressions).</li>
      <li>Linear models for panel data: <pkg>plm</pkg>, providing a wide range of within,
          between, and random-effect methods (among others) along with corrected standard
	  errors, tests, etc. For panel-corrected standard errors in OLS and GEE models,
	  see <pkg>geepack</pkg> and <pkg>pcse</pkg>. Estimation of linear models with
	  multiple group fixed effects is contained in <pkg>lfe</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Generalized method of moments (GMM) and generalized empirical likelihood (GEL):
          <pkg>gmm</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Spatial econometric models: The <view>Spatial</view> view gives details about
          handling spatial data, along with information about (regression) modeling. In particular,
	  spatial regression models can be fitted using <pkg>spdep</pkg> and <pkg>sphet</pkg> (the
	  latter using a GMM approach). <pkg>splm</pkg> is a package for spatial panel
          models. Spatial probit models are available in <pkg>spatialprobit</pkg>.</li>

	  handling of (generalized) linear regression models. <pkg>Zelig</pkg> is a unified
	  easy-to-use interface to a wide range of regression models.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Basic time series infrastructure</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <view>TimeSeries</view> task view provides much more detailed
          information. Here, only the most important aspects are briefly mentioned.</li>
      <li>The class <code>"ts"</code> in package stats is R's standard class for
          regularly spaced time series (especially annual, quarterly, and monthly data).</li>
      <li>Time series in <code>"ts"</code> format can be
	  coerced back and forth without loss of information to <code>"zooreg"</code>
	  from package <pkg>zoo</pkg>. <pkg>zoo</pkg> provides infrastructure for
	  both regularly and irregularly spaced time series (the latter via the class
	  <code>"zoo"</code>) where the time information can be of arbitrary class.
	  This includes daily series (typically with <code>"Date"</code> time index)
	  or intra-day series (e.g., with <code>"POSIXct"</code> time index).</li>
      <li>Several
	  other implementations of irregular time series building on the <code>"POSIXct"</code>
	  time-date class are available in <pkg>its</pkg>, <pkg>tseries</pkg> and 
	  <pkg>timeSeries</pkg> (previously: fSeries) which are all aimed particularly at

      <li>For estimating VAR models, several
	  methods are available: simple models can be fitted by <code>ar()</code> in stats, more
	  elaborate models are provided in package <pkg>vars</pkg>, <code>estVARXls()</code> in
	  <pkg>dse</pkg> and a Bayesian approach is available in <pkg>MSBVAR</pkg>. A
	  convenient interface for fitting dynamic regression models via OLS is available
	  in <pkg>dynlm</pkg>; a different approach
	  that also works with other regression functions is implemented in <pkg>dyn</pkg>.</li>
      <li>More advanced dynamic system equations can be fitted using <pkg>dse</pkg>.</li>

	  <pkg>tseries</pkg>, <pkg>CADFtest</pkg>, and <pkg>tsDyn</pkg>.</li>
      <li>Time series factor analysis is available in <pkg>tsfa</pkg>.</li>
