    <p>Base R ships with a lot of functionality useful for computational
    econometrics, in particular in the stats package. This
    functionality is complemented by many packages on CRAN, a brief overview
    is given below. There is also a considerable overlap between the tools
    for econometrics in this view and those in the task views on
    <view>Finance</view>, <view>SocialSciences</view>, and <view>TimeSeries</view>.    
    Furthermore, the 
    <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/R-SIG-Finance/">Finance SIG</a>    
    is a suitable mailing list for obtaining help
    and discussing questions about both computational finance and econometrics.</p>
    
    <p>The packages in this view can be roughly structured into the following topics.
    If you think that some package is missing from the list, please contact the maintainer.</p>

    <p><strong>Basic linear regression</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><i>Estimation and standard inference</i>: Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation for linear models is provided
          by <code>lm()</code> (from stats) and standard tests for model comparisons are available in various
	  methods such as <code>summary()</code> and <code>anova()</code>.</li>

      <li><i>Further inference and nested model comparisons</i>: Functions analogous to
          the basic <code>summary()</code> and <code>anova()</code> methods
	  that also support asymptotic tests (<i>z</i> instead of <i>t</i> tests, and
	  Chi-squared instead of <i>F</i> tests) and plug-in of other covariance
	  matrices are <code>coeftest()</code> and <code>waldtest()</code> in <pkg>lmtest</pkg>.
          Tests of more general linear hypotheses are implemented in <code>linearHypothesis()</code>
          and for nonlinear hypotheses in <code>deltaMethod()</code> in <pkg>car</pkg>.</li>

      <li><i>Robust standard errors</i>: HC and HAC covariance matrices are available in <pkg>sandwich</pkg>
          and can be plugged into the inference functions mentioned above.</li>

      <li><i>Nonnested model comparisons</i>: Various tests for comparing non-nested linear
          models are available in <pkg>lmtest</pkg> (encompassing test, J test, Cox test).
          The Vuong test for comparing other non-nested models is provided by <pkg>nonnest2</pkg>
	  (and specifically for count data regression in <pkg>pscl</pkg>).</li>

      <li><i>Diagnost checking</i>: The packages
	  <pkg>car</pkg> and <pkg>lmtest</pkg> provide a large collection
	  of regression diagonstics and diagnostic tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Microeconometrics</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>Generalized linear models (GLMs)</i>: Many standard microeconometric models belong to the
          family of generalized linear models and can be fitted by <code>glm()</code>
	  from package stats. This includes in particular logit and probit models
	  for modeling choice data and Poisson models for count data. Effects for typical
	  values of regressors in these models can be obtained and visualized using <pkg>effects</pkg>.
	  Marginal effects tables for certain GLMs can be obtained using the 
	  <pkg>mfx</pkg> package. Interactive visualizations of both effects and marginal
	  effects are possible in <pkg>LinRegInteractive</pkg>.</li>

      <li><i>Binary responses</i>: The standard logit and probit models (among many others) for binary
          responses are GLMs that can be estimated by <code>glm()</code> with <code>family = binomial</code>.
	  Bias-reduced GLMs that are robust to complete and quasi-complete separation are provided by
	  <pkg>brglm</pkg>. Discrete choice models estimated by simulated maximum likelihood are
	  implemented in <pkg>Rchoice</pkg>.</li>

      <li><i>Count responses</i>: The basic Poisson regression is a GLM that can be estimated by <code>glm()</code>
          with <code>family = poisson</code> as explained above.
	  Negative binomial GLMs are available via <code>glm.nb()</code> in package <pkg>MASS</pkg>.
	  Another implementation of negative binomial models
	  is provided by <pkg>aod</pkg>, which also contains other models for overdispersed
	  data. Zero-inflated and hurdle count models are provided in package <pkg>pscl</pkg>.
          A reimplementation by the same authors is currently under development in <rforge>countreg</rforge>
	  on R-Forge which also encompasses separate functions for zero-truncated regression,
	  finite mixture models etc.</li>

      <li><i>Multinomial responses</i>: Multinomial models
	  with individual-specific covariates only are available in <code>multinom()</code>
	  from package <pkg>nnet</pkg>. Implementations with both individual- and
	  choice-specific variables are <pkg>mlogit</pkg> and <pkg>mnlogit</pkg>. Generalized
	  multinomial logit models (e.g., with random effects etc.) are in <pkg>gmnl</pkg>.	  
	  Generalized additive models
	  (GAMs) for multinomial responses can be fitted with the <pkg>VGAM</pkg> package.	  
	  A Bayesian approach to multinomial probit models is provided by <pkg>MNP</pkg>.
	  Various Bayesian multinomial models (including logit and probit) are available
	  in <pkg>bayesm</pkg>. Furthermore, the package <pkg>RSGHB</pkg> fits various
	  hierarchical Bayesian specifications based on direct specification of the likelihood
	  function.</li>

      <li><i>Ordered responses</i>: Proportional-odds regression for ordered responses is implemented
          in <code>polr()</code> from package <pkg>MASS</pkg>. The package <pkg>ordinal</pkg>
	  provides cumulative link models for ordered data which encompasses proportional
	  odds models but also includes more general specifications. Bayesian ordered probit
	  models are provided by <pkg>bayesm</pkg>.</li>

      <li><i>Censored responses</i>: Basic censored regression models (e.g., tobit models)
	  can be fitted by <code>survreg()</code> in <pkg>survival</pkg>, a convenience
	  interface <code>tobit()</code> is in package <pkg>AER</pkg>. Further censored
	  regression models, including models for panel data, are provided in <pkg>censReg</pkg>.
	  Interval regression models are in <pkg>intReg</pkg>. Censored regression models with
	  conditional heteroskedasticity are in <pkg>crch</pkg>.
	  Furthermore, hurdle models for left-censored data at zero can be estimated with
	  <pkg>mhurdle</pkg>. Models for sample selection are available in <pkg>sampleSelection</pkg>
	  and semiparametric extensions of these are provided by <pkg>SemiParSampleSel</pkg>.
	  Package <pkg>matchingMarkets</pkg> corrects for selection bias when the sample is the
	  result of a stable matching process (e.g., a group formation or college admissions problem).</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Instrumental variables</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><i>Basic instrumental variables (IV) regression</i>: Two-stage least squares (2SLS)

	  in package <pkg>sem</pkg>, in <pkg>ivpack</pkg>, and <pkg>lfe</pkg> (with particular
	  focus on multiple group fixed effects).</li>

      <li><i>Binary responses</i>: An IV probit model via GLS estimation
          is available in <pkg>ivprobit</pkg>. The <pkg>LARF</pkg> package estimates
          local average response functions for binary treatments and binary instruments.</li>

	  </li>
    </ul>


    <p><strong>Panel data models</strong></p>
    
    <ul>

      <li><i>Panel-corrected standard errors</i>: A simple approach for panel data is
          to fit the pooling (or independence) model (e.g., via <code>lm()</code> or <code>glm()</code>)
	  and only correct the standard errors. Different types of panel-corrected standard
	  errors are available in <pkg>multiwayvcov</pkg>, <pkg>pcse</pkg>, <pkg>plm</pkg>,
	  and <pkg>geepack</pkg>, respectively. The latter two require estimation of the
	  pooling/independence models via <code>plm()</code> and <code>geeglm()</code> from
	  the respective packages (which also provide other types of models, see below).</li>      

      <li><i>Linear panel models</i>: <pkg>plm</pkg>, providing a wide range of within,
          between, and random-effect methods (among others) along with corrected standard
	  errors, tests, etc. Another implementation of several of these models is in

          analyzing panel data with large dimensions n and T and can be considered when
	  the unobserved heterogeneity effects are time-varying.</li>

      <li><i>Miscellaneous</i>: 
          Multiple group fixed effects are in <pkg>lfe</pkg>.

      <li><i>Spatial econometric models</i>: The <view>Spatial</view> view gives details about
          handling spatial data, along with information about (regression) modeling. In particular,
	  spatial regression models can be fitted using <pkg>spdep</pkg> and <pkg>sphet</pkg> (the
	  latter using a GMM approach). <pkg>splm</pkg> is a package for spatial panel
          models. Spatial probit models are available in <pkg>spatialprobit</pkg>.</li>

      <li><i>Bayesian model averaging (BMA)</i>: A comprehensive toolbox for BMA is provided by
          <pkg>BMS</pkg> including flexible prior selection, sampling, etc. A different implementation
          is in <pkg>BMA</pkg> for linear models, generalizable linear models and survival models (Cox regression).</li>

    </ul>

    <p><strong>Time series data and models</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <view>TimeSeries</view> task view provides much more detailed
          information about both basic time series infrastructure and time series models.
	  Here, only the most important aspects relating to econometrics are briefly mentioned.
	  Time series models for financial econometrics (e.g., GARCH, stochastic volatility models, or 
	  stochastic differential equations, etc.) are described in the <view>Finance</view>.</li>

      <li><i>Infrastructure for regularly spaced time series</i>: The class <code>"ts"</code> in package stats is R's standard class for
          regularly spaced time series (especially annual, quarterly, and monthly data). It can be
	  coerced back and forth without loss of information to <code>"zooreg"</code>
	  from package <pkg>zoo</pkg>.</li>

      <li><i>Infrastructure for irregularly spaced time series</i>: <pkg>zoo</pkg> provides infrastructure for
	  both regularly and irregularly spaced time series (the latter via the class
	  <code>"zoo"</code>) where the time information can be of arbitrary class.
	  This includes daily series (typically with <code>"Date"</code> time index)
	  or intra-day series (e.g., with <code>"POSIXct"</code> time index). An extension
	  based on <pkg>zoo</pkg> geared towards time series with different kinds of
	  time index is <pkg>xts</pkg>. Further packages aimed particularly at
	  finance applications are discussed in the <view>Finance</view> task view.</li>

      <li><i>Classical time series models</i>: Simple autoregressive models can be estimated
          with <code>ar()</code> and ARIMA modeling and Box-Jenkins-type analysis can be
	  carried out with <code>arima()</code> (both in the stats package). An enhanced
	  version of <code>arima()</code> is in <pkg>forecast</pkg>.</li>

      <li><i>Linear regression models</i>: A convenience interface to <code>lm()</code>
          for estimating OLS and 2SLS models based on time series data is <pkg>dynlm</pkg>.
          Linear regression models with AR error terms via GLS is possible
          using <code>gls()</code> from <pkg>nlme</pkg>.</li>

          Further packages are discussed in the <view>TimeSeries</view> task view.</li>

      <li><i>Filtering and decomposition</i>: <code>decompose()</code> and <code>HoltWinters()</code>
          in stats. The basic function for computing filters (both rolling and autoregressive) is
	  <code>filter()</code> in stats. Many extensions to these methods, in particular for
	  forecasting and model selection, are provided in the <pkg>forecast</pkg> package.</li>

      <li><i>Vector autoregression</i>: Simple models can be fitted by <code>ar()</code> in stats, more
	  elaborate models are provided in package <pkg>vars</pkg> along with suitable diagnostics,
	  visualizations etc. A Bayesian approach is available in <pkg>MSBVAR</pkg>.</li>

      <li><i>Unit root and cointegration tests</i>: <pkg>urca</pkg>,
	  <pkg>tseries</pkg>, <pkg>CADFtest</pkg>.</li>

	  Financial Time Series' (2nd ed., 2005, Wiley) containing data sets, functions
          and script files required to work some of the examples.</li>

          data packages with time series data
	  from the books 'Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing: The State Space Approach'
	  (Hyndman, Koehler, Ord, Snyder, 2008, Springer) and 'Forecasting: Methods and Applications'
	  (Makridakis, Wheelwright, Hyndman, 3rd ed., 1998, Wiley) and the M-competitions,
	  respectively.</li>
      <li><i>Empirical Research in Economics</i>: Package <pkg>erer</pkg> contains functions and datasets for the book of

      <li><i>Optimization and mathematical programming</i>: R and many of its contributed
          packages provide many specialized functions for solving particular optimization
	  problems, e.g., in regression as discussed above. Further functionality for
