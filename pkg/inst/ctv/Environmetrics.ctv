	    <h4>Introduction</h4>
	    <p>This Task View contains information about using R to analyse ecological and environmental data.</p>
	    <p>The base version of R ships with a wide range of functions for use within the field of environmetrics.
	    This functionality is complemented by a plethora of packages available via CRAN, which provide specialist
	    methods such as ordination &amp; cluster analysistechniques. A brief overview of the available packages is 
	    provided in this Task View, grouped by topic or type of analysis. As a testament to the popularity of R for the 
	    analysis of environmental and ecological data, a <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v22/" >special volume</a> of 
	    the <em>Journal of Statistical Software</em> was produced in 2007.</p>
	    <p>Those useRs interested in environmetrics should consult the <view>Spatial</view> view. 
	    Complementary information is also available in the <view>Multivariate</view> and <view>Cluster</view> task
	    views.</p>
	    <p>If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements, then please contact the
	    <a href="mailto:gavin_DOT_simpson_AT_ucl_DOT_ac_DOT_uk?subject=Environmetrics Task View">maintainer</a>.</p>
	    <p>A list of available packages and functions is presented below, grouped by analysis type.</p>
	    
	    <h4>Modelling species responses and other data</h4>
	    <p>Analysing species response curves or modeling other data often involves the fitting of standard statistical models 
	    to ecological data and includes simple (multiple) regression, Generalised Linear Models (GLM), extended regression 
	    (e.g. Generalised Least Squares [GLS]), Generalised Additive Models (GAM), and mixed effects models, amongst 
	    others.</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>The base installation of R provides <tt>lm()</tt> and <tt>glm()</tt> for fitting linear and generalised
	        linear models, respectively.</li>
	        <li>Generalised least squares and linear and non-linear mixed effects models extend the simple regression model
	        to account for clustering, heterogeneity and correlations within the sample of observations. Package <pkg>nlme</pkg>
	        provides functions for fitting these models. The package is supported by Pinheiro &amp; Bates (2000) 
	        <em>Mixed-effects Models in S and S-PLUS</em>, Springer, New York. An updated approach to mixed effects models, 
	        which also fits Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Generalised non-Linear Mixed Models (GNLMM) is provided 
	        by the <pkg>lme4</pkg> package, though this is currently beta software and does not yet allow correlations within 
	        the error structure.</li>
	        <li>Recommended package <pkg>mgcv</pkg> fits GAMs and Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) with 
	        automatic smoothness selection via generalised cross-validation. The author of <pkg>mgcv</pkg> has
	        also written a companion monograph, Wood (2006) <em>Generalized Additive Models; An Introduction with R</em>
	        Chapman Hall/CRC, which has an accompanying package <pkg>gamair</pkg>.</li>
	        <li>Alternatively, package <pkg>gam</pkg> provides an implementation of the S-PLUS function <tt>gam()</tt> that 
	        includes LOESS smooths.</li>
	        <li>Proportional odds models for ordinal responses can be fitted using <tt>polr()</tt> in the MASS package,
	        part of the <pkg>VR</pkg> bundle, of Bill Venables and Brian Ripley.</li>
	        <li>A negative binomial family for GLMs to model over-dispersion in count data is available in MASS, part of
	        the <pkg>VR</pkg> bundle.</li>
	        <li>Package <pkg>pscl</pkg> also contains several functions for dealing with over-dispersed count data. Poisson or 
	        negative binomial distributions are provided for both zero-inflated and hurdel models.</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h4>Tree-based models</h4>
	    <p>Tree-based models are being increasingly used in ecology, particularly for their ability to fit flexible models to
	    complex data sets and the simple, intuitive output of the tree structure. Ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and
	    random forests are advocated for improving predictions from tree-based models and to provide information on uncertainty
	    in regression models or classifiers.</p>
	    <p>Tree-structured models for regression, classification and survival analysis, following the ideas in the CART book, 
	    are implemented in</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>recommended package <pkg>rpart</pkg></li>
	        <li><pkg>party</pkg> provides an implementation of conditional inference trees which embed tree-structured regression 
	        models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Multivariate trees are available in</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>package <pkg>mvpart</pkg>, which provides an adaptation of <pkg>rpart</pkg> for multivariate responses.</li>
	        <li>package <pkg>party</pkg> can also handle multivariate responses.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Ensemble techniques for trees:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>The Random Forest method of Breiman and Cutler is implemented in <pkg>randomForest</pkg>, providing classification 
	        and regression based on a forest of trees using random inputs</li>
	        <li>Package <pkg>ipred</pkg> provides functions for improved predictive models for classification, regression and 
	        survival problems.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Graphical tools for the visualization of trees are available in packages <pkg>maptree</pkg> and <pkg>pinktoe</pkg>.</p>
	    <p>Packages <pkg>mda</pkg> and <pkg>earth</pkg> implement Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), a technique
	    which provides a more flexible, tree-based approach to regression than the piecewise constant functions used in 
	    regression trees.</p>
  
	    <h4>Ordination</h4>
	    <p>R and add-on packages provide a wide range of ordination methods, many of which are specialised techniques
	    particularly suited to the analysis of species data. The two main packages are <pkg>ade4</pkg> and
	    <pkg>vegan</pkg>. <pkg>ade4</pkg> derives from the traditions of the French school of 
	    <q>Analyse des Donnees</q> and is based on the use of the duality diagram. <pkg>vegan</pkg> follows
	    the approach of Mark Hill, Cajo ter Braak and others, though the implementation owes more to that presented in
	    Legendre &amp; Legendre (1988) <em>Numerical Ecology, 2<sup>nd</sup> English Edition</em>, Elsevier. Where the
	    two packages provide duplicate functionality, the user should choose whichever framework that best suits their 
	    background.</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Principal Components (PCA) is available via the <tt>prcomp()</tt> function. <tt>rda()</tt> (in package 
	        <pkg>vegan</pkg>), <tt>pca()</tt> (in package <pkg>labdsv</pkg>) and <tt>dudi.pca</tt> (in
	        package <pkg>ade4</pkg>), provide more ecologically-orientated implementations. A form of PCA used 
	        in the climate and climate change fields is Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and is implemented
	        in <tt>EOF()</tt> in package <pkg>clim.pact</pkg>.</li>
	        <li>Redundancy Analysis (RDA) is available via <tt>rda()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg> and <tt>pcaiv()</tt> in 
	        <pkg>ade4</pkg>.</li>
	        <li>Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is implemented in <tt>cca()</tt> in both <pkg>vegan</pkg> and
	        <pkg>ade4</pkg>.</li>
            <li>Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) is implemented in <tt>decorana()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg>.</li> 
            <li>Principal coordinates analysis (PCO) is implemented in <tt>dudi.pco</tt> in <pkg>ade4</pkg>, <tt>pco()</tt>
            in <pkg>labdsv</pkg>, <tt>pco()</tt> in <pkg>ecodist</pkg>, and <tt>cmdscale()</tt> in package MASS in 
            <pkg>VR</pkg>.</li>
            <li>Non-Metric multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) is provided by <tt>isoMDS()</tt> in package MASS in bundle 
            <pkg>VR</pkg> and <tt>nmds()</tt> in <pkg>ecodist</pkg>. <tt>nmds()</tt>, a wrapper function for <tt>isoMDS()</tt>, 
            is also provided by package <pkg>labdsv</pkg>. <pkg>vegan</pkg> provides helper function <tt>metaMDS()</tt> for 
            <tt>isoMDS()</tt>, implementing random starts of the algorithm and standardised scaling of the NMDS results. 
            The approach adopted by <pkg>vegan</pkg> with <tt>metaMDS()</tt> is the recommended approach for ecological
            data.</li>
            <li>Coinertia analysis is available via <tt>coinertia()</tt> and <tt>mcoa()</tt>, both in <pkg>ade4</pkg>.</li>
            <li>Co-correspondence analysis to relate two ecological species data matrices is available in <pkg>cocorresp</pkg>.</li>
            <li>Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCoA - not to be confused with CCA, above) is available in <tt>cancor()</tt> 
            in standard package stats.</li>
            <li>Procrustes rotation is available in <tt>procrustes()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg> and <tt>procuste()</tt> in 
            <pkg>ade4</pkg>, with both <pkg>vegan</pkg> and <pkg>ade4</pkg> providing functions to test the significance of 
            the association between ordination configurations (as assessed by Procrustes rotation) using permutation/randomisation 
            and Monte Carlo methods.</li>
            <li>Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP), implemented in <tt>capscale()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg>,
            fits constrained ordination models similar to RDA and CCA but with any any dissimilarity coefficient.</li>
            <li>Constrained Quadratic Ordination (CQO; formerly known as Canonical Gaussian Ordination (CGO)) is a maximum likelihood 
            estimation alternative to CCA fit by Quadratic Reduced Rank Vector GLMs. Constrained Additive Ordination (CAO) is a 
            flexible alternative to CQO which uses Quafratic Reduced Rank Vector GAMs. These methods and more are provided in 
            Thomas Yee's <pkg>VGAM</pkg> package.</li>
            <li>Fuzzy set ordination (FSO), an alternative to CCA/RDA and CAP, is available in package <pkg>fso</pkg>.</li>
            <li>See also the <view>Multivariate</view> task view for complementary information.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h4>Dissimilarity coefficients</h4>
	    <p>Much ecological analysis proceeds from a matrix of dissimilarities between samples. A large amount of effort has
	    been expended formulating a wide range of dissimilarity coefficients suitable for ecological data. A selection of
	    the more useful coefficients are available in R and various contributed packages.</p>
	    <p>Standard functions that produce, square, symmetric matrices of pair-wise dissimilarities include:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li><tt>dist()</tt> in standard package stats</li>
	        <li><tt>daisy()</tt> in recommended package <pkg>cluster</pkg></li>
	        <li><tt>vegdist()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg></li>
	        <li><tt>dsvdis()</tt> in <pkg>labdsv</pkg></li>
	        <li><tt>Dist()</tt> in <pkg>amap</pkg></li>
	        <li><tt>distance</tt> in <pkg>ecodist</pkg></li>
	        <li>a suite of functions in <pkg>ade4</pkg></li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Function <tt>distance()</tt> in package <pkg>analogue</pkg> can be used to calculate dissimilarity between samples 
	    of one matrix and those of a second matrix. The same function can be used to produce pair-wise dissimilarity matrices,
	    though the other functions listed above are faster. <tt>distance()</tt> can also be used to generate
	    matrices based on Gower's coefficient for mixed data (mixtures of binary, ordinal/nominal and continuous variables).
	    Function <tt>daisy()</tt> in package <pkg>cluster</pkg> provides a faster implementation of Gower's coefficient for
	    mixed-mode data than <tt>distance()</tt> if a standard dissimilarity matrix is required.</p>
	    
	    <h4>Cluster analysis</h4>
	    <p>Cluster analysis aims to identify groups of samples within multivariate data sets. A large range of 
	    approaches to this problem have been suggested, but the main techniques are hierarchical cluster analysis, 
	    partitioning methods, such as <em>k</em>-means, and finite mixture models or model-based clustering. In the machine 
	    learning literature, cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning problem.</p>
	    <p>The <view>Cluster</view> task view provides a more detailed discussion of available cluster analysis methods and 
	    appropriate R functions and packages.</p>
	    <p>Hierarchical cluster analysis:</p>
	    <ul>
            <li><tt>hclust()</tt> in standard package stats</li>
            <li>Recommended package <pkg>cluster</pkg> provides functions for cluster analysis following the methods 
            described in Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990) <em>Finding Groups in data: an introduction to cluster analysis</em>,
            Wiley, New York</li>
            <li><tt>hcluster()</tt> in <pkg>amap</pkg></li>
            <li><pkg>pvclust</pkg> is a package for assessing the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. It provides 
            approximately unbiased <em>p</em>-values as well as bootstrap <em>p</em>-values.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Partitioning methods:</p>
	    <ul>
            <li><tt>kmeans()</tt> in stats provides <em>k</em>-means clustering</li>
            <li><tt>cmeans()</tt> in <pkg>e1071</pkg> implements a fuzzy version of the <em>k</em>-means algorithm</li>
            <li>Recommended package <pkg>cluster</pkg> also provides functions for various partitioning methodologies.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Mixture models and model-based cluster analysis:</p>
	    <ul>
            <li><pkg>mclust</pkg> and <pkg>flexmix</pkg> provide implementations of model-based cluster analysis.</li>
            <li><pkg>prabclus</pkg> clusters a species presence-absence matrix object by calculating an 
            <acronym title="Multi-dimensional Scaling">MDS</acronym> from the distances, and applying maximum likelihood Gaussian 
            mixtures clustering to the MDS points. The maintainer's, Christian Hennig, web site contains several publications in 
            ecological contexts that use <pkg>prabclus</pkg>, especially Hausdorf &amp; Hennig (2007; 
            <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15661.x">Oikos 116 (2007), 818-828</a>).</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h4>Models related to ecological theory</h4>
	    <!-- <p></p> -->
	    <ul>
	        <li><pkg>vegan</pkg> provides a wide range of functions related to ecological theory, such as diversity indices 
	        (including the <q>so-called</q>Hill's numbers [e.g. Hill's N<sup>2</sup>] and rarefaction), ranked abundance diagrams, 
	        Fisher's log series, Broken Stick model, Hubbell's abundance model, amongst others.</li>
	        <li><pkg>untb</pkg> provides a collection of utilities for biodiversity data, including the simulation ecological drift 
	        under Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity, and the calculation of various diagnostics such as Preston 
	        curves.</li>
	        <li>Package <pkg>BiodiversityR</pkg> provides a GUI for biodiversity and community ecology analysis.</li>
	        <li>Function <tt>betadiver()</tt> in <pkg>vegan</pkg> implements all of the diversity indices reviewed in Koleff et al (2003;

	        <!-- <tt>betadiver()</tt> also provides a <tt>plot</tt> method to produce the co-occurrence frequency triangle plots of the type
	        found in Koleff et al (2003).</li> -->
	        <li>Funtion <tt>betadisper()</tt>, also in <pkg>vegan</pkg>, implements Marti Anderson's distance-based test for homogeneity of 
	        multivariate dispersions (PERMDISP, PERMDISP2), a multivariate analogue of Levene's test (Anderson 2006; 
	        <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1541-0420.2005.00440.x">Biometrics 62, 245-253</a>). Anderson et al
	        (2006; <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00926.x">Ecology Letters 9(6), 683-693</a>) 
	        demonstrate the use of this approach for measuring beta diversity.</li>
