<p>
    This task view covers packages which include facilities for meta-analysis
    of summary statistics from primary studies. The task view does not consider
    the meta-analysis of individual participant data which can be handled by
    any of the standard linear modelling functions.
</p>

<p>
   The standard meta-analysis model is a form of weighted least squares and so
   any of the wide range of R packages providing weighted least squares would
   in principle be able to fit the model. The advantage of using a specialised package is
   that (a) it takes care of the small tweaks necessary (b) it provides a range
   of ancillary functions for displaying and investigating the model.
   Where the model is referred to below it is this  model which is meant.
</p>

<p>
   Where summary statistics are not available a meta-analysis of significance
   levels is possible. This is not completely unconnected with the problem
   of adjustment for multiple comparisons but the packages below which offer this,
   chiefly in the context of genetic data, also offer additional functionality.
</p>

<h4>Univariate meta-analysis</h4>
   <p><i>Preparing for meta-analysis</i></p>
   <ul>
   <li>The primary studies often use a range of statistics to present their
   results. Convenience functions to convert these onto a common
   metric are presented by:
   <pkg>compute.es</pkg> which converts from various statistics to
    d, g, r, z and the log odds ratio,
   <pkg>MAc</pkg> which converts to correlation coefficients,
   <pkg>MAd</pkg> which converts to mean differences,
   and
   <pkg>metafor</pkg> which converts to effect sizes an extensive set of measures
    for comparative studies (such as binary data, person years, mean differences and
    ratios and so on), for studies of association (a wide range of correlation types), for non-comparative
    studies (proportions, incidence rates, and mean change). It also provides for a measure 
    used in psychometrics (Cronbach's alpha).
   </li>
   <li>
    <pkg>meta</pkg> provides functions to read and work
    with files output by RevMan 4 and 5.
   </li>
   </ul>

   <p><i>Fitting the model</i></p>
   <ul>
   <li>
    Four packages provide the inverse variance weighted, Mantel-Haenszel,
    and Peto methods:  <pkg>epiR</pkg>,
    <pkg>meta</pkg>, <pkg>metafor</pkg>, and <pkg>rmeta</pkg>.
    The last three also provide cumulative meta-analysis.
    The same three provide the usual forest and funnel plots.
    In addition radial (Galbraith) plots are provided by <pkg>metafor</pkg>
    and L'Abbe plots by <pkg>meta</pkg> and <pkg>metafor</pkg>.
   </li>
   <li>
   For binary data <pkg>metafor</pkg> provides the binomial-normal model.
   </li>
   <li>
   For sparse binary data <pkg>exactmeta</pkg> provides an exact method which does not involve continuity
   corrections
   </li>
   <li>Packages which work with specific effect sizes may be more congenial
    to workers in some areas of science
    <pkg>MAc</pkg> and
    <pkg>metacor</pkg>
    which provide meta-analysis of correlation coefficients and 
    <pkg>MAd</pkg> which provides meta-analysis of mean differences.
    <pkg>MAc</pkg> and <pkg>MAd</pkg> provide a range of graphics.
    <pkg>psychometric</pkg>
    provides an extensive range of functions for the meta-analysis of 
    psychometric studies.
   </li>
   
   <li>
   Bayesian approaches are contained in various packages.
   <pkg>bspmma</pkg> which 
    provides two different models: a non-parametric and a semi-parametric.
    Graphical display of the results is provided.
   <pkg>metamisc</pkg> provides a method with priors suggested by Higgins.
   <pkg>mmeta</pkg> provides meta-analysis using
   beta-binomial prior distributions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Some packages concentrate on providing a specialised version of the core
    meta-analysis function without providing the range of ancillary
    functions. These are:
     <pkg>metaLik</pkg>
    which uses a more sophisticated approach to the likelihood,
    <pkg>metamisc</pkg> which as well as the method of moments provides two likelihood-based
    methods, and
    <pkg>metatest</pkg> which provides
     another improved method of obtaining confidence intervals.
   </li>
   <li><pkg>metagen</pkg> provides a range of methods for
   random effects models and also facilities
   for extensive simulation studies of the
   properties of those methods
   </li>
   </ul>

<i>Graphical methods</i>
   <p>
   In addition to the packages mentioned elsewhere
   <pkg>Gmisc</pkg> provides forest plots.
   </p>

<i>Investigating heterogeneity</i>
   <p>
    Confidence intervals for the heterogeneity parameter
    are provided in  <pkg>metafor</pkg>
    and <pkg>metagen</pkg>.
   </p>

<i>Investigating small study bias</i>
   <p>The issue of whether small studies give different results
   from large studies has been addressed by visual
   examination of  the funnel plots mentioned above.
   In addition:
   </p>
   <ul>
   <li> <pkg>meta</pkg> and <pkg>metafor</pkg> provide
   both the non-parametric method suggested by Begg and Mazumdar
   and a range of regression tests modelled after the approach of Egger.
   </li>
   <li>
   An exploratory technique for detecting an excess of statistically
   significant studies is provided by <pkg>PubBias</pkg>.
   </li>
   </ul>

<i>Unobserved studies</i>
   <p>
    A recurrent issue in meta-analysis has been
    the problem of unobserved studies.
   </p>
   <ul>
   <li>
    Rosenthal's fail safe n is provided by <pkg>metafor</pkg> as well as two more recent methods
    by Orwin and Rosenberg.
   </li>
   <li>
     Duval's trim and fill method is provided by <pkg>meta</pkg>
     and <pkg>metafor</pkg>.
   </li>
   <li>
    <pkg>copas</pkg> provides Copas's selection model.
   </li>
   <li>
   <pkg>selectMeta</pkg> provides various selection models:
     the parametric model of Iyengar
     and Greenhouse, the non-parametric model of Dear and Begg, and
      proposes a new non-parametric method imposing a monotonicity
      constraint.
   </li>
   <li>
   <pkg>SAMURAI</pkg> performs a sensitivity analysis assuming the number of unobserved
     studies is known, perhaps from a trial registry, but not their outcome.
   </li>
   <li>
   <pkg>extfunnel</pkg> augments the funnel plot to assess the impact
   of additional evidence.
   </li>
   </ul>

<i>Meta-analysis of significance values</i>
   <p>
   <pkg>metap</pkg> provides some facilities for
   meta-analysis of significance values.
   Some of these methods are also provided in some
   of the genetics packages mentioned below.
   </p>

<h4>Multivariate meta-analysis</h4>

   <p>Standard methods outlined above assume that the effect sizes
   are independent. This assumption may be violated in a number of ways:
   within each primary study multiple treatments may
   be compared to the same control, each primary study may report multiple
   endpoints, or primary studies may be clustered for instance
   because they come from
   the same country or the same research team.
   In these situations where the outcome is multivariate:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>
   <pkg>mvmeta</pkg> assumes the within study covariances
   are known and as well as fixed effects provides a
   variety of options for fitting random effects. <pkg>metafor</pkg>
   provides fixed effects and likelihood
   based random effects model fitting procedures.
   Both these packages include meta-regression,
   <pkg>metafor</pkg> also provides for clustered and
   hierarchical models
   </li>
   <li>
   <pkg>mvtmeta</pkg> provides multivariate meta-analysis 
   using the method of moments for random effects
   although not meta-regression,
   </li>
   <li>
   <rforge>metaSEM</rforge> is available from R-Forge and
   provides multivariate (and univariate) meta-analysis and
   meta-regression by embedding it in the structural equation framework
   and using OpenMx for the structural equation modelling.
   It can provide a three-level meta-analysis taking account of
   clustering and allowing for level 2 and level 3 heterogeneity.
   It also provides via a two-stage approach
   meta-analysis of correlation or covariance matrices.
   </li>
   <li>
   <pkg>dosresmeta</pkg> concentrates on the situation where individual
   studies have information on the dose-response relationship.
   </li>
   <li>
   <pkg>robumeta</pkg> provides robust variance estimation for
   clustered and hierarchical estimates.
   </li>
   </ul>

<h4>Meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic tests</h4>
  <p>
    A special case of multivariate meta-analysis is the case of summarising
    studies of diagnostic tests. This gives rise to a bivariate, binary
    meta-analysis with the within-study correlation assumed zero
    although the between-study correlation is estimated. This is an
    active area of research and a variety of methods are available
    including what is referred to here called Reitsma's
    method, and the heirarchical summary receiver operating
    characteristic (HSROC) method.
    In many situations these are equivalent.</p>

   <ul>
   <li>
    <pkg>mada</pkg> provides various descriptive statistics
     and univariate methods (diagnostic odds ratio and Lehman
     model)
     as well as the bivariate method due to Reitsma.
     Meta-regression is also provided.
     A range of graphical methods is also available.
   </li>
   <li>
    <pkg>HSROC</pkg> provides HSROC with estimation in a Bayesian framework.
    Graphical methods are provided.
    The case of imperfect reference standards is catered for.
   </li>
   <li>
   <pkg>Metatron</pkg> provides a method for the Reitsma model
    incuding the case of an imperfect reference standard
   </li>
   <li>
    <pkg>metamisc</pkg> provides the method of Riley which estimates a common
    within and between correlation. Graphical output is also
    provided.
   </li>
   <li>
   <pkg>bamdit</pkg> provides Bayesian meta-analysis with a bivariate
    random effects model (using JAGS to implement the MCMC method).
   </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Meta-regression</h4>
   <p>Where suitable moderator variables are available they may
    be included using meta-regression. All these packages are mentioned above, this
    just draws that information together.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>
    <pkg>metafor</pkg> provides meta-regression (multiple
    moderators are catered for). A range of model diagnostics is also
    provided. Various packages rely on <pkg>metafor</pkg> to
    provide meta-regression (<pkg>meta</pkg>, <pkg>MAc</pkg>,
    and  <pkg>MAd</pkg>).
   </li>
   <li>
    <pkg>metagen</pkg>,
    <pkg>metaLik</pkg>,    <rforge>metaSEM</rforge>, and
      <pkg>metatest</pkg> also provide meta-regression.
   </li>
   <li>
    <pkg>mvmeta</pkg> provides meta-regression for multivariate meta-analysis
    as does    <rforge>metaSEM</rforge>.
   </li>
   <li>
    <pkg>mada</pkg> provides for the meta-regression of diagnostic test studies.
   </li>
   </ul>

<h4>Network meta-analysis</h4>
   <p>Also known as multiple treatment comparison.</p>

   <p>This is provided in a Bayesian framework by <pkg>gemtc</pkg>,
   which acts as a front-end to your
   favourite MCMC package, and <pkg>pcnetmeta</pkg>,
   which uses JAGS. <pkg>netmeta</pkg>  works in a frequentist
   framework.
   Both <pkg>pcnetmeta</pkg> and <pkg>netmeta</pkg>
   provide network graphs and
   <pkg>netmeta</pkg> provides a heatmap for displaying inconsistency
   and heterogeneity
   </p>

<h4>Genetics</h4>
   <p>
    There are a number of packages specialising in genetic data:
   <pkg>gap</pkg> combines p-values,
   <pkg>MADAM</pkg> combines p-values using Fisher's method,
   <pkg>MAMA</pkg> provides meta-analysis of microarray data,
   <pkg>MetABEL</pkg> provides meta-analysis of genome wide SNP association
      results,
   <pkg>MetaDE</pkg> provides microarray meta-analysis of for differentially
      expressed dene detection,

    provides meta-analysis as part of a package primarily dedicated to the determination
    of sample size in cluster randomised trials.
   </p>
   <p>

    alternative to the random effects model where there is heterogeneity.
   Covariates can be included to provide meta-regression.
   </p>
