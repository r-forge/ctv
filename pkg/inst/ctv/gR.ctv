  defines a graphical model as <i>a graph that represents independencies
  among random variables by a graph in which each node is a random
  variable, and the missing edges between the nodes represent
  conditional independencies</i>.
  </p>

  This task view is a collection of packages intended to supply R code
  to deal with graphical models.

  The description of each package is accompanied by the statement
  [vignette: y/n]. The aim is to give users
  indications of to which extent a package is documented beyond the bare
  standard documentation. 
    
  <p>The packages can be roughly structured into the following topics
  (although several of them have functionalities which go across these categories):</p>

  <p><strong>Representation, manipulation and display of graphs</strong></p>
  <ul>

    <li>
    <pkg>diagram</pkg>  [vignette: y]
    Functions for visualising simple graphs (networks), plotting flow diagrams
    </li>

    <li>
    <pkg>dynamicGraph</pkg>   [vignette: n]
    Provides an advanced
    graphical user interface for display and interaction with
    graphs (based on Tcl/Tk).
    </li>

    <li>
    <pkg>giRaph</pkg> [vignette: n]
    Supply classes and methods to represent and manipulate graphs
    </li>

    <li>
    <pkg>graph</pkg> [vignette: y]

    </li>

    <li>
      <pkg>gRbase</pkg>   [vignette: y]

      <pkg>network</pkg>   [vignette: n; demo: n]
      Tools to create and modify network objects.  The network class can
      represent a range of relational data types, and supports arbitrary
      vertex/edge/graph attributes. 
    </li>

    <li>
      <pkg>RBGL</pkg> [vignette: y] 
      Interface to boost C++ graph library (based on graph
      objects from the <pkg>graph</pkg> package).
    </li>

  </ul>
  In addition, there is the
  <bioc>Rgraphviz</bioc>
  package on Bioconductor that provides plotting capabilities for R graph
  objects (from the <pkg>graph</pkg> package) [vignette: y].
  

  <p><strong>Classical models - General purpose packages</strong></p>
  <ul>

    <li>
      <pkg>ggm</pkg> [vignette: n]

    </li>
    
    <li>
      <pkg>gRbase</pkg> [vignette: y]
      The gRbase package provides certain general constructs
      which are used by other graphical modelling packages (in
      particular by <pkg>gRain</pkg>).
      This includes 1) the concept of gmData (graphical meta
      data), 2) several graph algorithms 3) facilities for
      table operations, 4) functions for testing for
      conditional independence. gRbase also illustrates how
      hierarchical log-linear models (hllm) may be
      implemented.
    </li>

      models for discrete, Gaussian, or mixed discrete and Gaussian
      data. Link: http://www.jstatsoft.org/v37/i01
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <pkg>mimR</pkg> [vignette: n]
      General package for model selection in contingency
      tabels, graphical Gaussian models and mixed interaction
      models. The package provides an interface to the MIM
      program and only runs on Windows.  
    </li>

  </ul>


  <p><strong>Miscellaneous: Model search, specialized types of models etc.</strong></p>
  <ul>

    <li>
      <pkg>SIN</pkg> [vignette: n]
      This package provides routines to perform SIN model selection as
      described in Drton and Perlman (2004).  The selected models are
      represented in the format of the 'ggm' package, which allows in 
      particular parameter estimation in the selected model. 
    </li>

    <li>
      <pkg>pcalg</pkg> [vignette: y]
      Standard and robust estimation of the skeleton (ugraph) and the equivalence class
      of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via the PC-Algorithm. The equivalence class is
      represented by its (unique) Completed Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (CPDAG).
    </li>

    <li>
      <pkg>qp</pkg> [vignette: n]
      This package is deprecated and it is now only a stub for the newer version called
      qpgraph available through the Bioconductor project. The q-order partial correlation
      graph search algorithm, q-partial, or qp, algorithm for short, is a robust
      procedure for structure learning of undirected Gaussian graphical Markov models
      from "small n, large p" data, that is, multivariate normal data coming from a
      number of random variables p larger than the number of multidimensional data points
      n as in the case of, e.g., microarray data.

      <pkg>parcor</pkg> [vignette: n]
      The package estimates the matrix of partial correlations based on different regularized

      provides model selection for lasso, adaptive lasso and Ridge
      regression based on
