  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model">Wikipedia</a>
  defines a graphical model as follows: <i>A graphical model is a
  probabilistic model for which a graph denotes the conditional
  independence structure between random variables. They are commonly
  used in probability theory, statistics - particularly Bayesian
  statistics and machine learning.</i>
  </p>

  A supplementary view is that graphical models are based on
  exploiting conditional independencies for constructing complex
  stochastic models with a modular structure. That is, a complex
  stochastic model is built up by simpler building blocks.

  This task view is a collection of packages intended to supply R code
  to deal with graphical models.

  <p>The packages can be roughly structured into the following topics
  (although several of them have functionalities which go across these categories):</p>

  <p><strong>Representation, manipulation and display of graphs</strong></p>

      project. The q-order partial correlation graph search algorithm,
      q-partial, or qp, algorithm for short, is a robust procedure for
      structure learning of undirected Gaussian graphical Markov
      models from "small n, large p" data, that is, multivariate

      undirected graphical Gaussian Markov models from data sets where
      the number of random variables p exceeds the available sample
      size n as, for instance, in the case of microarray data where
      they can be employed to reverse engineer a molecular regulatory
      network.

      Bayesian network structure learning via constraint-based (also known as
      'conditional independence') and score-based algorithms. This package implements the
      Grow-Shrink (GS) algorithm, the Incremental Association (IAMB) algorithm, the
      Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB) algorithm, the Fast-IAMB (Fast-IAMB) algorithm, the
      Max-Min Parents and Children (MMPC) algorithm and the Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy
      search algorithm for both discrete and Gaussian networks, along with many score
      functions and conditional independence tests. Some utility functions (model
      comparison and manipulation, random data generation, arc orientation testing) are
      also included.

    <li>
      <rforge>RHugin</rforge>
      The Hugin Decision Engine (HDE) is commercial software produced by
      HUGIN EXPERT A/S for building and making inference from Bayesian
      belief networks. The RHugin package provides a suite of
      functions allowing the HDE to be controlled from within the R
      environment for statistical computing. The RHugin package can
      thus be used to build Bayesian belief networks, enter and
      propagate evidence, and to retrieve beliefs. Additionally, the
      RHugin package can read and write hkb and NET files, making it
      easy to work simultaneously with both the RHugin package and the
      Hugin GUI. A licensed copy of the HDE (or the trial version) is
      required for the RHugin package to function, hence the target
      audience for the package is Hugin users who would like to take
      advantage of the statistical and programmatic capabilities of R.
      Notice: RHugin is NOT on CRAN.
