Changes in Version 0.4-0

  o New function update.views() which can query the list
    of packages contained in a view, query what is the
    latest version of those packages available and only
    install/update the packages that are not current.

  o Added infrastructure for version number, date and
    contact e-mail address of the maintainer.
    
  o Adapted the server-side tools to the new web-structure
    of CRAN.
