Changes in Version 0.7-9

  o <br/> tags are preserved as such in the <info> section.


Changes in Version 0.7-8

  o Use system.file() instead of .find.package() in vignette.


Changes in Version 0.7-7

  o Use system.file() instead of .find.package() in ?read.ctv.


Changes in Version 0.7-6

  o New function check_ctv_packages() for maintainers of CRAN task views.
    This checks whether <info> and <packagelist> are consistent and
    whether all packages are actually in the repository.
    

Changes in Version 0.7-5

  o Package depends on R >= 2.13.0 now in order to use only
    saveRDS()/readRDS() and not .saveRDS()/.readRDS().
    

Changes in Version 0.7-4

  o update.views() gains a "filter" argument passed to available.packages(),
    so that the packages can be filtered with respect to operating system
    type or free and open-source license etc.
    

Changes in Version 0.7-3

  o saveRDS() instead of .saveRDS() is now used in the server-side tools
    if available.
    

Changes in Version 0.7-2

  o avoid usage of &#8810; in Cluster.ctv because it is not processed
    correctly on all platforms

  o further improvement to available.views() which now uses readRDS() if
    available.
    

Changes in Version 0.7-1

  o fixed available.views() for R 2.13.0 as the underlying .readRDS()
    needed to be changed.
    

Changes in Version 0.7-0

  o added download.views() function (as suggested by Peter
    Ruckdeschel)
    
  o restructured internals of install.views() and update.views()
    so that all three functions can use the same code for determining
    the list of packages that is going to be installed/updated/downloaded.

  
Changes in Version 0.6-0

  o update.views() was updated reflecting that bundles are not
    supported anymore.
  

Changes in Version 0.5-6

  o modified code to avoid non-standard evaluation in subset().
  

Changes in Version 0.5-5

  o simplified printing of warnings (with
    useFancyQuotes = FALSE).
  

Changes in Version 0.5-4

  o grep(..., extended = FALSE) replaced by the more
    appropriate grep(..., fixed = TRUE).
  

Changes in Version 0.5-3

  o The R-Forge links created from <rforge> are now
    forced to be in lower case.
  

Changes in Version 0.5-2

  o Minor changes to improve generation of tidy HTML.
  

Changes in Version 0.5-1

  o In .ctv files a new tag is allowed: <ohat> for
    links to Omegahat projects.
    
  o The tags <rforge> and <gcode> replace the previous
    <forge> and <googlecode>, respectively, in order
    to be more consistent with the terminology used
    in the CRAN Web pages.

  o Further improvements of server-side tools in order
    to provide tidy XHTML code.

  o The default style file included in the server-side
    tools is now CRAN_web.css (rather than R.css).


Changes in Version 0.5-0

  o Improved server-side tools: read.ctv() and ctv2html()
    now try harder to provide tidy XHTML code.


Changes in Version 0.4-9

  o added CITATION file


Changes in Version 0.4-8

  o new <googlecode> tag


Changes in Version 0.4-7

  o removed \itemize in .Rd files for new R-devel.


Changes in Version 0.4-6

  o Changed interface of install.views() and update.views():
    Argument "dependencies = TRUE" has been removed (but can
    still be specified through "..."). Hence, by default, the
    defaults of install.packages() are inherited. However,
    is still possible to get the prior behaviour by setting
    dependencies explicitly in install.views()/update.views().


Changes in Version 0.4-5

  o Enhanced support for R-Forge and Bioconductor links
    (new <bioc> tag, similar to <forge>).


Changes in Version 0.4-4

  o Enhanced UTF-8 support.


Changes in Version 0.4-3

  o Enabled UTF-8 support for character fields in CTV files.


Changes in Version 0.4-2

  o Updated vignette to better reflect the latest changes.
  

Changes in Version 0.4-1

  o Added new tags <code> and <forge> for CTV files.


Changes in Version 0.4-0

  o New function update.views() which only installs the
    packages from a view that are not installed or not
    up-to-date.

  o Added infrastructure for view version/date and
    contact e-mail address of the maintainer.
    
  o Adapted the server-side tools to the new web-structure
    of CRAN.
