Changes in Version 0.5-6

  o modified code to avoid non-standard evaluation in subset().

    useFancyQuotes = FALSE).

  o grep(..., extended = FALSE) replaced by the more
    appropriate grep(..., fixed = TRUE).

  o The R-Forge links created from <rforge> are now
    forced to be in lower case.

  o Minor changes to improve generation of tidy HTML.
  

Changes in Version 0.5-1

  o In .ctv files a new tag is allowed: <ohat> for
    links to Omegahat projects.
    
  o The tags <rforge> and <gcode> replace the previous
    <forge> and <googlecode>, respectively, in order
    to be more consistent with the terminology used
    in the CRAN Web pages.

  o Further improvements of server-side tools in order
    to provide tidy XHTML code.

  o The default style file included in the server-side
    tools is now CRAN_web.css (rather than R.css).

  o Improved server-side tools: read.ctv() and ctv2html()
    now try harder to provide tidy XHTML code.


Changes in Version 0.4-9

  o added CITATION file


Changes in Version 0.4-8

  o new <googlecode> tag


Changes in Version 0.4-7

  o removed \itemize in .Rd files for new R-devel.


Changes in Version 0.4-6

  o Changed interface of install.views() and update.views():
    Argument "dependencies = TRUE" has been removed (but can
    still be specified through "..."). Hence, by default, the
    defaults of install.packages() are inherited. However,
    is still possible to get the prior behaviour by setting
    dependencies explicitly in install.views()/update.views().


Changes in Version 0.4-5

  o Enhanced support for R-Forge and Bioconductor links
    (new <bioc> tag, similar to <forge>).


Changes in Version 0.4-4

  o Enhanced UTF-8 support.


Changes in Version 0.4-3

  o Enabled UTF-8 support for character fields in CTV files.


Changes in Version 0.4-2

  o Updated vignette to better reflect the latest changes.
  

Changes in Version 0.4-1

Changes in Version 0.4-0

  o New function update.views() which only installs the
    packages from a view that are not installed or not
    up-to-date.

  o Added infrastructure for view version/date and
    contact e-mail address of the maintainer.
    
  o Adapted the server-side tools to the new web-structure
    of CRAN.
