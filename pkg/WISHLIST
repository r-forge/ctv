  o update.views()
    This should query the list of packages contained in 
    a CTV, query what is the latest version of those
    packages available and only install/update the 
    packages that are not current.
    
  o add (unified) infrastructure for e-mail contact
    It would be nice if there was some way that we could
    include contact information for the maintainers within
    a .ctv file. It would be important that this could be
    found and used by human readers and R, but not by
    robots.

  o repository type
    There was some discussion, in particular with KH,
    that some infrastructure should be added to CRAN
    and other CRAN-style repositories so that a mirror
    knows whether it is a CRAN mirror or a BioC mirror
    or... When that is available, we could use it in
    ctv.
